    This works by storing a buffer with the `window_size` most recent observations. A brute-force
    search is used to find the `n_neighbors` nearest observations in the buffer to make a
    prediction.

    Parameters:
        n_neighbors: Number of neighbors to use.
        window_size: Size of the sliding window use to search neighbors with.
        p: Power parameter for the Minkowski metric. When `p=1`, this corresponds to the
            Manhattan distance, while `p=2` corresponds to the Euclidean distance.
        weighted: Whether to weight the contribution of each neighbor by it's inverse
            distance or not.

    Example:

        >>> from creme import datasets
        >>> from creme import evaluate
        >>> from creme import metrics
        >>> from creme import neighbors
        >>> from creme import preprocessing
