So the following appears to get desirable behavior:\r\n\r\n```\r\nif ( $?SPACK_OLD_PROMPT ) `set prompt=\"$SPACK_OLD_PROMPT\" && unsetenv SPACK_OLD_PROMPT` ;\r\n```\r\n\r\nI likewise had to make a similar edit to `pathadd.csh` to get `setup-env.csh` to work:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/share/spack/csh/pathadd.csh b/share/spack/csh/pathadd.csh\r\nindex ec394e8990..7f3424518a 100644\r\n--- a/share/spack/csh/pathadd.csh\r\n+++ b/share/spack/csh/pathadd.csh\r\n@@ -22,7 +22,7 @@ endif\r\n set _pa_old_value = \"\"\r\n eval set _pa_set = '$?'$_pa_varname\r\n if ($_pa_set == 1) then\r\n-    eval set _pa_old_value='$'$_pa_varname\r\n+    eval `set _pa_old_value = '$'$_pa_varname`\r\n endif\r\n \r\n # Do the actual prepending here, if it is a dir and not already in the path\r\n```\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @scheibelp in https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/25409#issuecomment-953332271_",
