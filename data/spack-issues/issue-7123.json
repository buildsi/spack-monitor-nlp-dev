    "body": "Depends on #7116 and #7121.\r\n\r\n#7121 set up a source mirror for Spack.  This adds to the release process so that binaries are also released.  The upload of release tarballs to an S3 store should happen once a release branch is merged to master, so that binaries are available to users and so that they can be the default install mechanism.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Once the release is merged to master, binaries are deployed to the public S3 binary mirror.\r\n",
