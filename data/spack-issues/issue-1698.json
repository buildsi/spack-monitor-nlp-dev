    "body": "Fixes #1692.  \n1. The bug in #1692 was related to not hashing build dependencies.  This is fixed, with a TODO to update things when we concretize based on already-installed packages.\n2. This turned out to actually need stable hashes to pass tests properly, so it also merges #1409, with modifications to clean up the `spec.yaml` and not to use weird YAML `!!` object flags in the output.\n\n**NOTE**: this will change hashes, but merging #1409 is overdue so I'd like to get it over with.  I may throw in a few other hash changes with this.\n\nPlease try this out to make sure it addresses #1692.  @brettviren @jgalarowicz @glennpj @eschnett \n",
