    "body": "I keep running into issues with spack downloading packages from sourceforge, the default mirror seems to be down a lot and the installation stops.\n\nI know I can work around this by manually downloading each failed package directly choosing a different sourceforge mirror and putting it into a specific directory in the spack tree, and/or by setting up a site-wide mirror location, but I would hope that the manual fetch could be automated. At the very least, (copy-and-pastable?) instructions on how to do this could be printed out when a download fails.\n",
