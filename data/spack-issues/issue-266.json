    "body": "With Python 3, I noticed that when I activated py-nose that I was getting a conflict in setuptools and with cached .pyc files in the **cache** directory. This had two sources, one was that Python 3 was automatically building setuptools. To resolve this, I added the --without-ensurepip configure arg for Python >3 and instead require users to explicitly build setuptools. The second issue is the cached .pyc files, so I just ignore any .pyc files in the **pycache** directory upon activation. Let me know if this sounds reasonable and looks OK.\n",
