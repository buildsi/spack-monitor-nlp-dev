    "body": "I ended up dropping the old version of JasPer because\r\n\r\n1. They switched the build system from Autotools to CMake\r\n2. They switched from `.zip` to `.tar.gz`\r\n\r\nIf someone really needs it, I can add support for it, but if not, I'd rather leave it out. It increases the complexity of the package too much.\r\n\r\nP.S. Successfully installed on macOS 10.13.4 with Clang 9.0.0. Passed all of its own tests.",
