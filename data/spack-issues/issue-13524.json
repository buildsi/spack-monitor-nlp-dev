    "body": "4af4487 added a `mirror_id` function to most `FetchStrategy` implementations that is used to calculate resource locations in mirrors. It left out `BundleFetchStrategy` which broke all packages making use of `BundlePackage` (e.g. `xsdk`). This adds a noop implementation of `mirror_id` to `BundleFetchStrategy` so that the download/installation of `BundlePackage`s can proceed as normal.",
