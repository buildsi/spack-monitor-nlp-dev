    "body": "I'm on Linuxmint 18.1 having clang 3.8.0 installed via apt-get and work with the current development version of Spack. \r\n\r\nWhile the build of suite-sparse works well with gcc, it fails when build with clang via `spack install suite-sparse%clang`. This holds for all listed versions of suite-sparse (4.5.1, 4.5.3, 4.5.4) and also the current one (4.5.5). The error is always the same: \r\n\r\nAt a certain point in the build process (linking of libcholmod.so), clang is invoked with the `-fopenmp` flag, leading to the message `/usr/bin/ld: cannot find -lomp` and aborting the build process.",
