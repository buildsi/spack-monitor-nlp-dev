    "body": "Fixes in the file `packages/tpetra/core/src/Tpetra_Details_checkPointer.cpp` use the code that is guarded by `#if 1` and changed to `#if CUDA_VERSION < 11000`. CUDA-11 removed all deprecated attributes in `cudaPointerAttributes` (this file does not exist in master anymore)\r\n\r\nThe fixes in file `packages/tpetra/core/src/Tpetra_withLocalAccess.hpp spack-src/packages/tpetra/core/src/Tpetra_withLocalAccess.hpp` are stolen from the upstream `master` branch.\r\n\r\nI expect that the next trilinos release will fix both problems, so I restricted it to the versions `13.0.0:13:0.1`",
