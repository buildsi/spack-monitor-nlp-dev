    "body": "Will probably need to add tests for this but this should change it so that Cray platforms can correctly detect and use the front end architecture.\r\n\r\ndependencies of the root packages would not concretized with the correct architecture and instead would use the back-end concretizer. This changes it so that any dependencies of the root package will also acquire the same architecture.\r\n\r\nWe also did not set the front target into the cray platform as an attribute to the platform class. I would get an error where it would attempt to module swap x86_64 but obviously there is no need to swap since x86_64 is not a module. \r\n\r\nAddresses #4828 ",
