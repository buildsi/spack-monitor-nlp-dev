    "body": "This PR adds a recipe for C-Reduce: https://embed.cs.utah.edu/creduce/\r\n> C-Reduce is a tool that takes a large C, C++, or OpenCL file that has a property of interest (such as triggering a compiler bug) and automatically produces a much smaller C/C++ file that has the same property. It is intended for use by people who discover and report bugs in compilers and other tools that process source code.\r\n\r\nIt also adds recipes for some Perl dependencies:\r\n - `perl-exporter-lite`\r\n - `perl-getopt-tabular`",
