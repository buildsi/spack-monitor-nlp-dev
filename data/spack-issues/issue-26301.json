    "body": "- Third attempt of introducing `libglvnd` as described [here](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/17697)\r\n- Introduced EGL interface using `libglvnd`\r\n- Generalized mesa-demos to depend on `gl` instead of `mesa`\r\n- Changed `provides(gl@:x.x, when=@x.x:)` to `provides(gl@:x.x, when=@x.x)` for all versions except most recent inside `opengl`. The former version would not be solvable because of conflicting variants.",
