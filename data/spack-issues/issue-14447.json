    "body": "@tgamblin @alalazo @scheibelp \r\n\r\nSample PR to remove tildes (negative variants) from `depends_on()` directives.  This is because such directives can cause spurious concretization errors.  (And they have in the past; sorry I can't figure out where right now).\r\n\r\nThe problem with this PR is that some on/off variants are used to model features; whereas others are used to model mutually exclusive alternatives.  Tildes in `depends_on()` are only a problem for feature-type variants; whereas alternative-type variants should probably be converted to use Spack's multi-valued variant mechanism.\r\n\r\nThis PR is woefully incomplete.  It is presented for demo purposes only at this point, not to merge.\r\n",
