    "body": "- The Primer3 project moved to GitHub.\r\n\r\n  - update the URL\r\n  - compare the tarballs 2.3.7 from Sourceforge and github, no\r\n    significant differences (e.g. the Sourceforge tarball contained a\r\n    couple of \"tmp\" files).\r\n  - update the signature for the 2.3.7 tarball.\r\n\r\n- @2.3.7 doesn't build with gcc@8.4.0, there's a dubious pointer/int\r\n  comparison that causes an error.  It was fixed upstream in newer\r\n  versions, apply simple patch to this version so that it continues to\r\n  be build-able with newer compilers.  See:\r\n\r\n  - https://github.com/primer3-org/primer3/issues/2\r\n  - https://github.com/primer3-org/primer3/issues/3\r\n\r\n- Add info for @2.5.0, which builds cleanly.",
