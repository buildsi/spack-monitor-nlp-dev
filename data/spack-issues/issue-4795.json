    "body": "I recently added a package for *ada* that `depends_on(r-rpart)`.  I just tried to activate it and it failed.  If I understand what's happening, `rpart` is part of the R core and I should not have added a dependency for it in the package.\r\n\r\nIs that correct?  If so I'll update the package.\r\n",
