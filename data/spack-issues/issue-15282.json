That functionality is in a separate\r\nlibrary, called `libtinfo`. \r\n\r\nThis ensures that ncurses is built to include termlib support and \r\nremoves the override for the library location, trusting our pkg-config\r\nto sniff it out.\r\n\r\nAll versions of tmux in its package definition built successfully on a CentOS box and ldd shows the binary was linked against spack libtinfo.\r\n\r\nAdditional details in: https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/15281\r\n\r\nCloses #15281",
