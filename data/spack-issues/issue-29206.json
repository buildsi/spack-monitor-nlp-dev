    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI wanted to create an environment containing `py-torch@1.9.1+cuda`. Unfortunately it's not picking up CUDA, e.g. I get a `+cuda`-spec, but it's actually not properly linking CUDA! However it does, when building standalone with roughly the same spec (didn't lock every minor python dep but CUDA/cudnn/nccl)! The `spack-build-01-install-out.txt` says very weirdly it couldn't find CUDA (see below as \"Error message\"). This could be related to the fact that in the finished environment, the libcudart.so is also not found in the `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.\r\n\r\nI remember the last time I had this problem I just built the spec, then added this to the environment. However, due to added dependencies this is not feasible now.\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\nIn the `spack-build-01-install-out.txt` I see that CUDA is not found when building within the environment:\r\n```\r\n  -- Could NOT find CUDA (missing: CUDA_CUDART_LIBRARY) (found version \"10.2\")\r\n  CMake Warning at cmake/public/cuda.cmake:31 (message):\r\n    Caffe2: CUDA cannot be found.
