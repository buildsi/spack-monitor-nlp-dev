    "body": "XCode Clang does not ship with OpenMP support, and in general it would be useful if the Kokkos package could build for compilers without OpenMP (e.g. Kokkos::View is an independently useful concept). Therefore, the `--with-openmp` flag in the Kokkos build should be guarded by an `openmp` feature that can be optionally disabled.\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\nSuccessful kokkos install with the default Mac compiler.\r\n\r\n### Actual Result\r\n[spack-build.out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/1944580/spack-build.out.txt)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install kokkos %clang@9.0.0-apple\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Proposed successful installation\r\n\r\n```console\r\n# spack install kokkos -openmp %clang@9.0.0-apple\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\nmacOS High Sierra with up-to-date XCode command line tools",
