    "body": "I develop some packages at SNL that have per-variant submodules and there isn't currently a way to update them, without doing things like monkey-patching `Package._make_stage` to intercept and override calls to the fetch strategy's `fetch` method.  This PR allows a package to define a `submodules` method that returns the submodules needed.  The method is called by the package's fetcher when the source code is being fetched.  Eg,\r\n\r\n```\r\nMyPackage(Package):\r\n    def submodules(self):\r\n        if \"+baz\" in self.spec:\r\n            return [\"baz\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\nallows `MyPackage` to update its `baz` submodule only when the `+baz` variant is requested.",
