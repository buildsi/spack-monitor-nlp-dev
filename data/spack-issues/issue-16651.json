    "body": "### Rationale\r\n\r\nCurrently, it is not possible to reinstall or delete a package declared in an environment spec matrix:\r\n\r\nhttps://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html#spec-matrices\r\n\r\nThis is a blocker for reinstalling a given package in the matrix within the environment. The workaround for this is to uninstall the package globally, then reinstall it within the environment.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nThis is accurate as of spack version 0.14.2.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
