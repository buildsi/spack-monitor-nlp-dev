    "body": "This feature support to jail Spack inside a chroot (see #5193 approach 3 for details).\r\nThis allows to find potential missing depends_on calls.\r\n\r\nIt introduces the commands:\r\n\r\n./spack isolate --build-environment path/to/jail/dir --tarball path/to/tarball\r\nTo create a jail for Spack and mount bind /dev, /sys and /proc to be available inside the jail.\r\n\r\n./spack isolate --remove-environment\r\nTo unmount the mounted /dev, /sys and /proc directories.\r\n\r\n./spack isolate --cli\r\nTo start a shell inside the jail.\r\n\r\nTo create a bootstrap environment it is possible to use an already generated tarball from OpenStack or by using mkosi. A restriction is, that the root directory of the tarball must be a directory which contains the distribution.\r\n\r\nBecause the mount bind process requires root rights, there are currently three approaches to solve this issue.\r\n1) By being root user.\r\n2) By register the /dev, /sys and /proc directories into fstab via the --permanent option, when building the jail with --build-environment. This operation requires to be root.\r\n3) By starting a daemon via ./spack isolate --start-daemon. This allows every user to mount bind /dev, /sys and /proc to the desired location.\r\n4) If someone knows a better method I'm happy to change the current one.",
