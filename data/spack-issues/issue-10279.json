    "body": "The m4 package fails to build with the ARM compiler with the error:\r\n```\r\nundefined reference to `__muloti4`\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is essentially the same error as mentioned in #4883, and the same fix will also work here.  (The ARM compiler is based on LLVM, so this isn't too surprising.)  Pull request will be coming shortly.\r\n",
