    "body": "(edits for typos, prose)\r\n\r\nSee #5745 for ~come~ some backstory.\r\n\r\nPerl installs a couple of config files that need to be munged so that they don't refer to the spack compiler.  These files are installed by perl read-only.  The munging uses `filter_file`, and behind the scenes `filter_file` moves its file to a safe place, and tries to create a working file that is both O_WRONLY and has the perms of the original file.  On one of my systems with an NFSv4 filesystem, the combination of `r--r--r--` and O_WRONLY throws a permissions error.  Building on a local/`xfs` filesystem on the same host works.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds a simple context manager that temporarily makes the files writable.  \r\n\r\nI'm not sure that `make_tmp_writable`:\r\n\r\n1. ~is the best name, will people confuse it with `/tmp`?~\r\n2. should really be a method, but my python-fu wasn't sufficient to make it a simple function.\r\n\r\nTested on CentOS 7 on NFSv4, xfs, gpfs, and NFSv3 filesystems.",
