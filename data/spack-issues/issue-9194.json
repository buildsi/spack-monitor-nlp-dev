    "body": "This MR introduces a package for the Gaudi HEP data processing framework, used by the LHCb and ATLAS experiments among other projects.\r\n\r\nGaudi also depends on RELAX, a set of ROOT dictionaries for typical HEP libraries. Since I know of no other package that depend on RELAX, I decided to bundle the two in this MR in order to save administrative/review work, but I can separate the two submissions if you think that is useful.\r\n\r\nThere is a small part of the RELAX package which I'm not very proud of, so I will highlight it in the MR thread and let you decide if there is a better way to do this.",
