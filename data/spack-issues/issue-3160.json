This causes problems on Power systems, because subclasses of AutotoolsPackage do not update these files automatically when they are in nonstandard places.\r\n\r\nI can submit a fix for this that recursively finds and updates those two files, but I wanted to see if anyone has any moral or philosophical objections first.",
