    "body": "Fixes #1098.\n1. Distinguish between static (package) and dynamic (spec) graphs.\n   - `spack graph`: dynamic graphs include information from particular specs (instances of\n     packages) and can have multiple instances with hashes.\n   - `spack graph --static`: static graphs ignore conditions and multiple instances (hashes) and\n     plot raw dependencies among packages.\n2. Allow graphing all packages in the install DB with `spack graph --installed`\n   - useful for debugging.\n3. Can now specify dependency type to traverse with `spack graph`, e.g.:\n   - `spack graph --deptype build,link,run` (default)\n   - `spack graph --deptype build,run` or `spack graph --deptype nolink`\n   - etc.\n4. `spack graph` now concretizes specs by default (this was confusing to people).\n   - `spack graph --normalize` skips concretization for those who know what that means.\n5. Fix bug in left-collapsing graph nodes.\n6. update `graph_ascii` to handle deptypes, too.\n",
