Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install superlu-mt@3.1%intel@20.0.1 +blas~int64+openmp+pic~pthread\r\n```\r\nfails with errors like\r\n```console\r\ndlamchtst.o: In function `main':\r\ndlamchtst.c:(.text+0x36): undefined reference to `__kmpc_begin'\r\ndlamchtst.c:(.text+0x1cf): undefined reference to `__kmpc_end'\r\n```\r\nGoogling and other research suggests that this is due to the lack of providing the correct openmp flag during the link stage.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-ivybridge\r\n```\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5312622/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5312623/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\nNo maintainers found for superlu-mt\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x ] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x ] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
