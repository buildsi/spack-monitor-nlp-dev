    "body": "This PR adds [Config File Variables](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#config-file-variables) to `upstreams.yaml`'s `install_tree` and `modules` paths.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see it  cherry-picked on `v0.15`, if you don't mind, because it looked like a bug the first time I tried to use variables there, especially since `configs.yaml`'s `install_tree` and `module_roots` support them.\r\n",
