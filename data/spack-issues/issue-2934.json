    "body": "blas_libs and lapack_libs in both MKL packages (intel-mkl and intel-parallel-studio) currently return ```libpthread.so libm.so libdl.so``` without paths, which produces linking failures in some packages that depend on blas (e.g. MUMPS).\r\n\r\nI guess there's some reason for avoiding using ```-lpthread -lm -ldl``` and letting the linker figure paths out?",
