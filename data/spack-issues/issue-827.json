    "body": "There are many python packages that depend on py-numpy. Each one of\nthose will have a copy of f2py that will need to be put in the ignore\nlist for activation. This PR adds f2py to the ignore list in the python\npackage.py file so that it does not have to be done for each package\nthat depends on py-numpy. This follows the model of what is done for\npy-setuptools.\n\nThis PR also removes the f2py ignore expression for python packages\nthat were using it as it is no longer needed in the individual packages.\n",
