    "body": "When binaries called with `spack external find` do no to return, spack itself does not return. As the `spack external find` command does expand regular expressions, there can be more problematic binaries called than intended. This problems e.g occurs when `drkonqui` is installed as it contains a script called `installdbgsymbols.sh` which waits for input, before it returns.\r\nOne solution for this issue is #21989, which does add an exclude pattern to `spack external find`. \r\nAs @alalazo noted in the request, a timeout will also solve this issue and is a more robust solution.",
