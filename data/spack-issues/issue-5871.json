    "body": "Hi, folks!\r\n\r\nHere's my docker-based development setup.  It should be very easy to use, all you need is the latest versions of docker and docker-compose.  There's a small README that explains the basic usage and there is support for running in a container running Ubuntu and Fedora, with more choices on the way if there is interest.\r\n\r\nThe code running spack in the container is the same as your local working copy, letting you experiment in a clean environment while you make changes.  Installed packages show up under your local working copy under `./opt` and are shared and persist between multiple containers.\r\n\r\nWe can merge, if enough people like this, or we can keep the branch as-is.  The changes stand well enough on their own that they should be easy to cherry-pick.",
