Problem is, the set of things needed by each user is different, so it's hard to know what centralized integration tests to set up.\n\nInstead, how about user-based integration tests?  Each user (who wants to run integration tests) would provide a list of things that Spack should build, and a list of things Spack should try doing once it's build them.  These tests would be (automatically) run periodically, with results automatically posted back to GitHub when things fail.  The integration tester framework should be easy to set up, of course.\n",
