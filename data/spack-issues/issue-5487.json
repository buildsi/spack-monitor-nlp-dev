Now, normal variants are in the python code itself set as either `True` or `False`. But, there is no need for `spack info` to use _exactly_ the same verbiage in its output. On the other hand, I think it should be consistent too.\r\n\r\nI am happy to adjust code but don't honestly know what the preferred output would be...\r\n\r\n```\r\nVariants:\r\n    Name [Default]    Allowed values    Description\r\n    pic [on]                  on, off          Produce position-independent code (for shared libs)\r\n    shared [on]            on, off          Enables the build of shared libraries.\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nVariants:\r\n    Name [Default]    Allowed values    Description\r\n    pic [True]              True, False         Produce position-independent code (for shared libs)\r\n    shared [False]       True, False          Enables the build of shared libraries.\r\n```\r\n\r\nor, using just `T` or `F` saves a lot of horizontal real estate\r\n\r\n```\r\nVariants:\r\n    Name [Def]    Allowed    Description\r\n    pic [T]             T, F           Produce position-independent code (for shared libs)\r\n    shared [F]       T, F           Enables the build of shared libraries.\r\n```\r\n\r\nor\r\n\r\n```\r\nVariants:\r\n    Name [Def]    Allowed values    Description\r\n    pic [+]              +, ~                 Produce position-independent code (for shared libs)\r\n    shared [~]        +, ~                 Enables the build of shared libraries.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI kinda like this latter one as it uses spack command line speak.\r\n",
