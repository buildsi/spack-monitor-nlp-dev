    "body": "`spack setup` has been unmaintained for several years and there are dozens of open issues for this. In addition, it only ever supported the `CMakePackage` base class, and there are no unit tests for it. Since then, `spack dev-build` has more or less replaced much of the functionality that `spack setup` once provided, supports all build systems, and is well tested. This PR deprecates `spack setup` in favor of `spack dev-build`.\r\n\r\nCloses #17737 \r\nCloses #15575\r\nCloses #12519\r\nCloses #12231\r\nCloses #10403\r\nCloses #9395\r\nCloses #9108\r\nCloses #5546\r\nCloses #5254 \r\nCloses #4920\r\nCloses #2597\r\nCloses #2339 \r\nCloses #2319\r\nCloses #2235\r\nCloses #2085\r\nCloses #2055\r\n",
