    "body": "Spack uses whatever patchelf it finds in the PATH, which is a very bad idea, cause system patchelf is typically broken by default on debian. If you're not on patchelf 0.13, it may produce broken executables, it fails to patch files larger than 2GB, and so on and so forth. See https://github.com/NixOS/patchelf/compare/0.9...0.13 for all we're missing in ubuntu 18.04.\r\n\r\nOne instance where patchelf breaks is #27566 ",
