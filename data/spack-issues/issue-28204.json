    "body": "This PR includes the following changes to the `sqlite` package:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add new versions 3.37.0 and 3.37.1\r\n- [x] Change `+rtree` to default to True (same as Autotools default)\r\n- [x] Add new `+dynamic_extensions` variant\r\n- [ ] Auto-detect `+dynamic_extensions` variant\r\n\r\nI'm having a bit of trouble with the last one. We can't test `load_extension` without an extension to load. We could build and load a custom minimal extension but I don't know SQL well enough to write one. I think there are examples in the docs.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully builds on macOS 10.15.7 with Apple Clang 12.0.0.\r\n\r\nCloses #28186",
