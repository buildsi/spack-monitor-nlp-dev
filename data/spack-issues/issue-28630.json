    "body": "Refers to #19736\r\nRefers to #26721\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new `sticky` argument to the variant directive. The argument is set to `False` by default, in which case the semantics of variants during concretization is the usual one. If set to `True` the variant being marked sticky cannot be changed by `clingo` during concretization and will either be set to:\r\n1. An explicit value set in a spec literal\r\n2. The default value set in `package.py` or in `packages.yaml`\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] Add a `sticky` argument to the variant directive\r\n- [x] Add unit tests to verify the semantic of `sticky`\r\n- [x] Add documentation\r\n- [x] Re-add #19736 and make the `allow-unsupported-compiler` sticky  ",
