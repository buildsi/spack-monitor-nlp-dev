    "body": "When loading a module with `spack load` the module doesn't show up in `module list`, however the module still takes effect.\r\n\r\nI checked an older system where spack is on version `0.12.1` and there it works, though rolling back to that version didn't help.\r\nThe spack git repo also defaults to the `develop` branch, which I found interesting, but checking out `releases/v0.14` also didn't help.\r\n\r\n### Spack version\r\n<!-- Add the output to the command below -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.14.0-126-9edf812\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ nvim --version\r\n-bash: nvim: command not found\r\n$ spack load neovim\r\n$ nvim --version\r\nNVIM v0.3.4\r\n[...]\r\n$ module list\r\nNo Modulefiles Currently Loaded.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nOS: `CentOS 7.7.1908`\r\nModule version: `Modules Release 4.4.0 (2019-11-17)`\r\n\r\nThe system was just setup, I cloned `https://github.com/spack/spack.git` and activated it with `source /path/to/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh` in my `.bashrc`\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
