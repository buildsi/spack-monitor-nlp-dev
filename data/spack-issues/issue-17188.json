    "body": "Previously, spack package `xssp` installed two utils: `dssp` and `hssp`. Now, the tool authors have removed the `xssp` repository, and replaced with two that must be installed separately. The link to `xssp` redirects to `hssp`, and therefore, spack package `xssp` would install only `hssp`.\r\n\r\nIn this PR, I create a new spack package `dssp` and rename `xssp` to `hssp`.\r\n\r\nCC: @asmaahassan90 (maintainer of `xssp`)",
