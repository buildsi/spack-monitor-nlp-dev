    "body": "I think it might be possible to cut the build time of ncurses in half.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWhen we build ncurses, we build both `--enable-widec` and `--disable-widec`. This is needed because some packages that depend on ncurses expect `libncursesw`, while others expect `libncurses`.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI noticed that the [Homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/ncurses.rb) recipe for ncurses instead builds with `--enable-widec` and then adds symlinks from `libncurses` to `libncursesw` for all of the installed libraries.\r\n\r\n@sknigh it looks like you did the original `widec` split in #3953. Can you take a look at this?",
