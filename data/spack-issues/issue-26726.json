    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\n\n```\r\nspack install groff\r\n\r\n<errors about eqn not being installed\r\n```\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.16.3\r\n* **Python:** 3.9.7\r\n* **Platform:** linux-mageia9-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\n\n### Additional information\n\nI cannot consistently reproduce the error, but it appears that there is an issue with parallel builds.  If the latter part of the build begins before eqn is built, this triggers an error.  The builds will work consistently in single threaded mode, but when I multithread the builds I get errors about the eqn executable not being found.\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
