Suppose you do this:\n> \n> ```\n> A:\n>     variant('python', default=True, 'enable python bindings')\n>     depends_on('python@2.7', when='+python')\n>     def patch(self):\n>         # do whatever is necessary to enable/disable python bindings according to variant\n> B:\n>     variant('python', default=True, 'enable python bindings')\n>     depends_on('python@3.2:', when='+python')\n>     def patch(self):\n>         # do whatever is necessary to enable/disable python bindings according to variant\n> C:\n>     depends_on('A~python')\n>     depends_on('B~python')\n> ```\n> \n> That will result in potentially more copies of A and B than you want but it will work.\n",
