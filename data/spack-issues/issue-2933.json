    "body": "- [x] Switching the coverage reports from coveralls to codecov\r\n  - The codecov interface is cleaner and easier to read/browse.\r\n    - also shows more details clearly (partials, branches, etc.)\r\n  - Can show coverage changes line by line in GitHub with [a browser plugin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/codecov-extension/keefkhehidemnokodkdkejapdgfjmijf)\r\n- [x] Simplified `.travis.yml`\r\n- [x] Added some tests for `spack graph`\r\n\r\nCodecov seems to report lower coverage numbers than coveralls, but that's ok.",
