Not sure if this should be part of `spack install` or `spack buildcache install`.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThe idea is once stack is built in buildcache anyone may want to install the entire buildcache in arbitrary path. This is useful for software stack admins who want to deploy a stack (E4S) from buildcache.\r\n\r\nI had to run the following command to get all hash and install them via spack\r\n```\r\n$ spack buildcache list -L | awk '{print $1}' | tail -n +2 | while read line; do spack install --cache-only /$line; done\r\n==> bzip2@1.0.8 : externally installed in /usr\r\n[+] /usr\r\n==> lz4@1.9.2 : externally installed in /usr\r\n[+] /usr\r\n[+] /global/common/software/spackecp/e4s-20.10/software/cray-cnl7-haswell/intel-19.1.2.254/snappy-1.1.8-atj34663shxhcn6xwoldqztpzwgd2kpi\r\n[+] /global/common/software/spackecp/e4s-20.10/software/cray-cnl7-haswell/intel-19.1.2.254/zlib-1.2.11-54rpg6zvck3wygq7ic3igd5hovdmge2m\r\n[+] /global/common/software/spackecp/e4s-20.10/software/cray-cnl7-haswell/intel-19.1.2.254/libfabric-1.11.0-rilhzysw3nqmzmne4t35fmq75zljizgk\r\n[+] /global/common/software/spackecp/e4s-20.10/software/cray-cnl7-haswell/intel-19.1.2.254/libffi-3.3-plapxdrpyavisllsrc7y3xhbxe2vajho\r\n==> libpng@1.6.37 : externally installed in /usr\r\n```",
