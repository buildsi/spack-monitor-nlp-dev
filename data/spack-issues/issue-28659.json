    "body": "In Spack 0.17 we got module sets (modules:[name]:[prop]), and for\r\nbackwards compat modules:[prop] was short for modules:default:[prop].\r\n\r\nBut this makes it awkward to define default config for the \"default\"\r\nmodule set, since they override the top-level properties.\r\n\r\nSince 0.17 is branched off, we can now deprecate top-level module config\r\n(that is, just ignore it with a warning).\r\n\r\nThis PR does that, and it implements `spack config update modules` to\r\nmake upgrading easy (we should have added that to 0.17 already...)\r\n\r\nIt also removes references to  `dotkit` stuff which was already\r\ndeprecated in 0.13 and could have been removed in 0.14.",
