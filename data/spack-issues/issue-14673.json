    "body": "PR #14202 adds a `containerize` to create Docker/Singularity recipes from a spack.yaml file. The recipe will install specs, prune the stack, then flatten the image in a new stage to reduce the final image's size. Flattening the image destroyes the spack environment, and prevents its reuse as a base image for a larger stack. A couple changes are required to allow for both modes of file creation.\r\n\r\nAdd a `--base-image` flag to change the recipe's behavior:\r\n- The Spack directory is copied into the next image stage.\r\n- Allow spack.yaml to use any image instead of a defined list\r\n- Do not allow striping\r\n- Use `spack gc -y` and `spack clean -a` before copying the image into the next stage",
