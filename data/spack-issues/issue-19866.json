    "body": "* No version of yaml-cpp in spack can build shared AND static libraries at the same time. So drop the \"static\" variant and let \"shared\" handle that alone.\r\n\r\n  Or in other words: No version handles the BUILD_STATIC_LIBS flag.\r\n\r\n* The flag for building shared libraries changed from BUILD_SHARED_LIBS to YAML_BUILD_SHARED_LIBS at some point. So just pass both flags.\r\n\r\n* Use the newer define_from_variant.",
