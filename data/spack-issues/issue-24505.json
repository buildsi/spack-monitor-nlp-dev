    "body": "Spack pipelines need to take specific actions internally that depend\r\non whether the pipeline is being run on a PR to spack or a merge to\r\nthe develop branch.  Pipelines can also run in other repositories,\r\nwhich represents other possible use cases than just the two mentioned\r\nabove.  This PR creates a \"SPACK_PIPELINE_TYPE\" gitlab variable which\r\nis propagated to rebuild jobs, and is also used internally to determine\r\nwhich pipeline-specific tasks to run.\r\n\r\nOne goal of the PR is fix an issue where rebuild jobs which failed on\r\ndevelop pipelines did not properly report the broken full hash to the\r\n\"broken-specs-url\".",
