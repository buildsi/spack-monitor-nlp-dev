    "body": "Now that #11392 landed, on to the feature improvements!\r\n\r\nThis allows the llvm build to support:\r\n\r\n* clang cuda\r\n* libomptarget for:\r\n  * current host\r\n  * cuda\r\n* bitcode compilation of libomptarget device runtime for inlining by bootstrapping libomptarget\r\n* split dwarf information support as an option for debug builds, if you need a debug build, for the love of all that's good in the universe use this flag\r\n* adds necessary dependencies for shared library builds and libomp and libomp target to build correctly\r\n* new version of z3 to make it sufficient to build recent llvm\r\n\r\nThe actual change is much smaller than the diff, this is because it's been formatted with black.  I realize this kinda sucks right now, but I'm hoping it will make future updates here less painful.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of future updates, this should really have AMD offload as well, but we don't have an AOMP package, so that's going to be next.\r\n\r\n@homerdin, I'd appreciate your feedback on this if you have a bit of time, thanks again on the big lift to get the monorepo swap done.",
