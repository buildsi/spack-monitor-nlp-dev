    "body": "Same as #2845 but for `CMakePackage` this time.\r\n\r\nAt this point, almost every package in Spack that uses CMake uses the `CMakePackage` base class. There are still a few complicated packages that I didn't want to deal with, like packages that use Autotools for older versions and CMake for newer versions.\r\n\r\nMuch like #2845, I'm sure there are at least a couple packages that I messed up, so please give this a thorough review. If you want me to split this up into 56 different PRs, I can do that, but I figured it would be easier to review all at once.",
