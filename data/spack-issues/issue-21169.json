    "body": "Fixes behavior when module/spack loading git when using the +svn variant. The run env for Git was updated to point to the location of the dynamic libs to load. In addition apr-util needed to be type link as well in the perl-alien-svn recipe. A change was also made to highlight that the path stitching for LD_LIBRARY_PATH is only valid on linux platforms.",
