    "body": "With this change, `spack create` now detects the Octave build system and adds the appropriate package name, extension, and installation instructions. According to @davydden in #1113, the only reliable ways to identify an octave extension are the URL:\n\n```\nhttp://downloads.sourceforge.net/octave/<package>-<version>.tar.gz?download\n```\n\nand the fact that the archive contains a file, `DESCRIPTION`, which contains the line:\n\n```\nDepends: octave (>= 3.6.0)\n```\n\nSince `DESCRIPTION` doesn't sound  like a particularly uncommon filename and I didn't want to start extracting tarballs and checking file contents, I went with the former.\n\n@davydden does everything look good to you?\n",
