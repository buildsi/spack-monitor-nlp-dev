    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nI have an environment with a bunch of packages including openssl and python. It creates a view. I add this `view/bin/` folder to my path. Now I run `spack external find openssl`. This adds an entry:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  openssl:\r\n  - spec: openssl@1.1.1k\r\n    prefix: /root/my_environment/view\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I run `spack install python`. Python *fails* to install, because everything in the environment view is exposed to the build, not just openssl.\r\n\r\nMaybe spack should follow the symlink (recursively) of whatever executable it detects in the PATH?\r\n\r\n",
