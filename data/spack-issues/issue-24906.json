    "body": "Darshan's codebase has just been updated to utilize automake, and thus makes sense to convert Darshan's packages into `AutotoolsPackage`s. \r\n\r\nMost of the changes are obvious to convert to `AutotoolsPackage`, but also includes changes to some of Darshan's configure parameters that occurred as part of a general revamp of the Darshan build system.\r\n- darshan-runtime HDF5 module is enabled slightly differently (`--enable-hdf5-mod` no longer takes an argument)\r\n- `--enable-shared` no longer a supported option for darshan-util -- shared libraries will just be built if libtool determines it can do so\r\n- darshan-util has new configure options for enabling APMPI and APXC modules",
