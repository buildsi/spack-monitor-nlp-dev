    "body": "I am thinking of adding a `+examples` variant to MFEM so that it can build, optionally, all of MFEM's examples. \r\n\r\nOn the one hand, this makes life simpler for me. OTOH, adding such a variant, which does nothing to affect how the package is installed, is probably totally meaningless to Spack.\r\n\r\nWhat is the right answer here? Avoid adding stuff to packages that have nothing to do with installing said pacakges (e.g. outcome of `make install` is no different either way)? Or, this is ok and/or encouraged?",
