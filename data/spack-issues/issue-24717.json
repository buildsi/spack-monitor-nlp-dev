    "body": "This PR includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a `gui` multi-valued variant to select passphrase entry backends to build\r\n- [x] Remove `--enable-shared` and `--enable-static` (non-existing options)\r\n- [x] Add smoke tests\r\n\r\nWhen I build `gui=tty,curses`, it decides to make `curses` the default backend. I'm not sure if there is any way to control this or not. On the `gpg` side of things, I can set my own default in `~/.gnupg/gpg-agent.conf`, but I don't know how you would do that in the `gnupg` package. I guess we could make the variant not-multi-valued and set the path explicitly, or add another variant for `default_gui`, but that seems complicated.",
