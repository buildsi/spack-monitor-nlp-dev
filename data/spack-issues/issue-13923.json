    "body": "\r\n@tgamblin  As spack community grows you may want to think of a Governance model. See https://opensource.guide/leadership-and-governance/\r\n\r\nI am guessing Spack is using a BFDL model and you are the BFDL. If so there is a template you can see at http://oss-watch.ac.uk/resources/benevolentdictatorgovernancemodel\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a ``GOVERNANCE.md`` file from node https://github.com/nodejs/node/blob/master/GOVERNANCE.md\r\n\r\nOr take a look at Jupyter https://github.com/jupyter/governance\r\n\r\nI know this may be tricky but worth it in long term when there are many core developers to spack.
