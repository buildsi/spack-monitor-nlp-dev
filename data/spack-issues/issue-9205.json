If I comment out the dependency, then it build OK. \r\n\r\nI am a bit unsure how this ever worked, although since it has been there for quite some time, I presume that it did. So, I was not confident enough to suggest changing it without guidance, hence I am raising an issue, rather than a pull request. Feel free to tell me I am doing something silly. \r\n\r\n",
