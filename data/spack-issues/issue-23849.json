    "body": "QUCS - Quite Universal Circuit Simulator:\r\nQucs is an integrated circuit simulator which means you are able to\r\nsetup a circuit with a graphical user interface (GUI) and simulate\r\nthe large-signal, small-signal and noise behaviour of the circuit.\r\nAfter that simulation has finished you can view the simulation results\r\non a presentation page or window.\r\nIt seems the project is stuck at Qt 4, but it may still be interesting for loyal users.\r\n",
