They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists.\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt]()\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt]()\r\n-->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [ ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
