But it cannot be executed because the path for __init__.py was set incorrectly in bin/pymol. Instead of the full path, the path refers to the PyMOL root folder and is /lib/python3.8/site-packages/pymol/__init__.py.\r\n\r\nDo you have any idea what the reason could be?\r\n\r\nI see in the setup.py\r\n\r\n````\r\n  out.write('#!/bin/sh' + os.linesep)\r\n                if not self.pymol_path_is_default:\r\n                    out.write(f'export PYMOL_PATH=\"{pymol_path}\"' + os.linesep)\r\n                out.write('exec \"%s\" \"%s\" \"$@\"' % (python_exe, pymol_file) + os.linesep)\r\n````\r\n\r\nThis creates a wrong file (bin/pymol), which looks like this\r\n\r\n````\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nexec \"/dss/dsshome1/lrz/sys/spack/release/22.1.0/opt/x86_64/python/3.8.11-gcc-6xhos72/bin/python3.8\" \"/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pymol/__init__.py\" \"$@\"```\r\n````\r\nIt should be,\r\n\r\n````\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\nexec \"/dss/dsshome1/lrz/sys/spack/release/22.1.0/opt/x86_64/python/3.8.11-gcc-6xhos72/bin/python3.8\" \"/dss/dsshome1/lrz/sys/spack/release/22.1.0/opt/x86_64/python/3.8.11-gcc-6xhos72/lib/python3.8/site-packages/pymol/__init__.py\" \"$@\"```\r\n````\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.12\r\n* **Platform:** linux-sles15-haswell\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
