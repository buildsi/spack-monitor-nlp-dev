    "body": "Adds a `--safe-only` flag to the `spack versions` command. Also prevents the printing of tty messages unless printing to the terminal.\r\n\r\nThe idea for this use case came from @robertmaynard in #10003. With this PR, one can run:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack versions -s cmake | xargs -n 1 spack fetch cmake@\r\n```\r\nor:\r\n```bash\r\nfor version in $(spack versions -s cmake)\r\ndo\r\n    spack fetch cmake@version\r\ndone\r\n```\r\nto test downloads of every version of a package.\r\n\r\nWe should probably have a more thought out command to do this task, but this is a quick, generic hack to give the same functionality.",
