    "body": "`spack list` tests are not using mock packages for some reason, and many are marked as potentially slow. This isn't really necessary; we don't need 6,000 packages to test the command.\r\n\r\n- [x] update tests to use `mock_packages` fixture\r\n- [x] remove `maybeslow` annotations\r\n\r\n\r\nNot sure why we weren't using mock packages to begin with, but this should speed up the tests for `spack list`. The hope is to avoid the error that @haampie reported in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/26735#issuecomment-952393879.  I suspect it is because the output is large and there are issues getting it all in a string in `SpackCommand`, so this will hopefully help.\r\n\r\nbefore:\r\n\r\n```\r\n8 passed, 3174 deselected in 28.29 seconds\r\n```\r\n\r\nafter:\r\n\r\n```\r\n8 passed, 3174 deselected in 6.04 seconds\r\n```\r\n",
