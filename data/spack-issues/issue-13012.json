Source for this info [here](https://developer.arm.com/docs/den0024/latest/aarch64-floating-point-and-neon).\r\n\r\nOn the other hand the base procedure call standard for Aarch64:\r\n\r\n> assumes the availability of the vector registers for passing floating-point and SIMD arguments. \r\n\r\nFurther:\r\n> the Arm 64-bit architecture defines two mandatory register banks: a general-purpose register bank which can be used for scalar integer processing and pointer arithmetic; and a SIMD and Floating-Point register bank\".\r\n\r\nSource for this info [here](https://developer.arm.com/docs/ihi0055/latest/procedure-call-standard-for-the-arm-64-bit-architecture).\r\n\r\nThis makes customization of Aarch64 with no NEON instructions available so unlikely that we can probably consider them a feature of the generic family. \r\n\r\n@fspiga @t-karatsu ",
