    "body": "This PR extracts the logic we use to detect external packages and puts it into its own Python package named `spack.detection`. In this way detection is available via API and can be reused for other purposes, e.g. bootstrapping. The structure is such that it can be easily extended to other search mechanisms, like scraping module files on Cray.\r\n\r\nA few aspects of detection have been slightly improved e.g. we can determine correctly the base directory for executables that are installed in a subdirectory within `<prefix>/bin`.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] Extract detection logic into its own Python package\r\n- [x] Determine correctly the prefix for packages installed in a subdirectory within the `<prefix>/bin` folder",
