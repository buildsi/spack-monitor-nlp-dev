    "body": "- Re-write mesa package to use the new meson build system\r\n- Drop backward compatibility with old mesa versions since meson wasn't reliably usable for the spack use cases of mesa until this release.\r\n- Express the swr driver as a variant\r\n- Additionally add the glx and glu virtual packages since they can be provided by a vendor's binary driver.\r\n- Drop the hardware drivers for now (they can be added later, but I don't believe there's much of a use case at the moment)\r\n- Rework downstream dependees to accommodate the changes.\r\n\r\nAlso supersedes #11301  ",
