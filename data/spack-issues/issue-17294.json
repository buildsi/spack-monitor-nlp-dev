    "body": "Hello, I am trying to install ```Spack``` on a cluster which seems to assume ```gcc@4.8.5``` as default. However I need Spack to be used by a code called ```PIConGPU``` whoose latest version makes use o ```gcc@7.4.0```.\r\n\r\nI downloaded ``Spack``` through git, as git clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git volatile/src/spack, sourced the environment as source volatile/src/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh and then I did ```spack compiler list | grep -q gcc@7.4.0 || spack install gcc@7.4.0 && spack load gcc@7.4.0 && spack compiler add``` once and another time with a completely fresh download of ```Spack``` I did ```spack install gcc@7.4.0~binutils```. The errors were identical as are shown below.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7108691/86005221-3e8ca500-ba0c-11ea-8ed6-cb074df9b13f.png)\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/7108691/86005234-43515900-ba0c-11ea-8a60-bae1a360f850.png)\r\n\r\nPlease let mek now how could I find a work around for my problem.\r\nMany thnaks,\r\n\r\nCristian\r\n",
