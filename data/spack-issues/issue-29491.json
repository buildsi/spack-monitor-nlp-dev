    "body": "### Summary\n\nCurrently on develop `spack install` and `spack spec` support the `--reuse` flag. `spack build-env` does not support this flag making it slightly awkward to use `spack install --reuse --only dependencies <spec>` and then `spack build-env` to get the same environment since one has to use the hash of the concretized spec instead of just using `spack build-env --reuse <spec>`.\r\n\r\nI've seen the note in the documentation about `--reuse` becoming the default in a future version, so I'm unsure if this is an intentional or unintentional omission. If you're planning on making `--reuse` the default soon I think this is a non-issue, but wanted to report in case the omission is unintentional.\n\n### Rationale\n\nConvenience in using `spack install --only dependencies --reuse <spec>` together with `spack build-env <spec>`.\n\n### Description\n\n`spack build-env` should accept a `--reuse` flag.\n\n### Additional information\n\n```\r\n> spack --version\r\n0.17.1-1545-474493713b\r\n```\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
