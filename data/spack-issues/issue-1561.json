    "body": "Fix bug in handling of precedence of preferred=True vs. versions given in packages.yaml (#1556)\n\nBTW... the code to compare versions is convoluted, inefficient and bug-prone.  A re-think might be in order, along the lines of this PR.  Rather than making a \"grand compare\" function, we might be better off keeping comparisons to simple things (like versions), and then writing code like the code here to produce prioritized lists when needed.\n",
