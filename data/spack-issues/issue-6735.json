    "body": "\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\nWhen loading `llvm+clang` the environment should have CC and CXX pointing to it.\r\n\r\n### Actual Result\r\n\r\nNo CC and CXX update of the environment. As such, if you have a system installation compiler (like gcc), loading llvm and running cmake chooses system compiler instead of spack's.\r\n\r\nThe llvm module has updates to PATH, MANPATH, etc, but no compilers.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install llvm@5.0.0\r\n$ spack load llvm\r\n$ env | grep CC\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nFedora 26",
