    "body": "additional to https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/19491 I add `docbook-{xml,xsl}` as dependency, which also the old python2 package `asciidoc` has. \r\n\r\nThis fixes a build problem of `ocl-icd` as these catalogs are needed to build the manpage.  Also `XML_CATALOG_FILES` needs to be exported in the build environment for `ocl-icd` as else way it won't be found, hence I added this to  `docbook-xml` and fix `docbook-xsl`, so it do not get overwrote or prepended with the wrong separator.",
