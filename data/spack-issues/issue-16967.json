    "body": "As a user I want Apple Clang to be a separate compiler from LLVM Clang so that they are distinguished more clearly.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nDespite the name of Apple's compiler is just `clang` the version numbers differ from vanilla LLVM and have to be distinguished by a `-apple` suffix. This is causing a complexity increase in e.g. the code that injects microarchitecture specific flags and is inconsistent with the treatment of other LLVM based compilers like `armclang`.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe proposed solution is to turn Apple Clang into a separate compiler named `appleclang` and reserve `clang` for vanilla LLVM.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOnce implemented this modification will change the hashes of every spec built with Apple Clang. This likely means the modification should go into the next minor release after the merge, not the next patch release.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
