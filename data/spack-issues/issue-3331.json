    "body": "Spack already knows everything about Spack-built compilers. It should simply consult `spack find` in addition to looking at `compilers.yaml`. This is similar to the way other dependencies are resolved; for these, Spack looks at the available packages as well as at `packages.yaml`.\r\n\r\nThis would also allow the next step: Spack should remember which package depends on a Spack-built compiler, since this is usually a run-time dependency as well (because of the run-time support libraries). Spack should take this into account with its other dependencies, e.g. when there is a request to uninstall a particular Spack-built compiler.",
