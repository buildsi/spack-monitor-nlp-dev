    "body": "This adds a `--path` option to `spack python` that shows the `python` interpreter that Spack is using.\r\n\r\ne.g.:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack python --path\r\n/Users/gamblin2/src/spack/var/spack/environments/default/.spack-env/view/bin/python\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is useful for debugging, and we can ask users to run it to understand what python Spack is picking up via preferences in `bin/spack` and via the `SPACK_PYTHON` environment variable introduced in #21222.",
