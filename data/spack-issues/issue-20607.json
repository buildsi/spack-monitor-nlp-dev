This is a subset of the \"concretizer\" label in the list of spack PRs. We hope/expect that it will be possible to accomplish this in fewer changes than needed for the ASP concretizer, simply because we know what we will need to build beforehand somewhat.\r\n\r\n- [ ] #19501\r\n    - #20503 is intended to produce a concretizer which is somewhat close to the abilities of the original python concretizer, so it would likely correspond to #19501 here.\r\n- [ ] #19988 \r\n- [ ] #20020 \r\n- [ ] #20082 \r\n- [ ] #20086 \r\n- [ ] #20099 \r\n- [ ] #20102 \r\n- [ ] #20128 \r\n- [ ] #20182 \r\n- [ ] #20193 \r\n- [ ] #20194 \r\n- [ ] #20203 \r\n- [ ] #20259 \r\n- [ ] #20307 \r\n- [ ] #20362 \r\n- [ ] #20383 \r\n- [ ] #20423 \r\n- [ ] #20473 \r\n- [ ] #20494 \r\n- [ ] #20499 \r\n- [ ] #20506 \r\n- [ ] #20507 \r\n- [ ] #20509 \r\n- [ ] #20537 \r\n- [ ] #20604",
