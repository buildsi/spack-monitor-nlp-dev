    "body": "This adds the `--exclude` option to the `spack external find` command.\r\nThis might be necessary as there exits programs which do not come back when they are called. One example is the shell script 'installdbgsymbols.sh` which is part of drkonqui.\r\nThere might also be other binaries, which might cause problems when called, as these programs require license or are on hanging file systems.",
