    "body": "This is a set of possible definitions, as raw material for the Spack Environments working groups.\r\n\r\n1. *Environment*: A set of records, each consisting of:\r\n   1. Fully concretized spec (DAG)\r\n   1. An indication of which packages below the top level of the DAG are to be visible.\r\n\r\n1. *Package Set*: A flat set of packages.  Typically produced from the visible packages of an environment.  No package can be represented more than once.\r\n\r\n1. *Environment Spec*: A set of records, each consisting of:\r\n   1. Non-concretized spec\r\n   1. An indication of which packages below the top level of the DAG are to be visible.\r\n   1. An indication of which platform and project to use when concretizing.\r\n\r\n1. *Platform*: A set of configurations affecting the concretization function (that converts non-concretized specs to fully concretized specs).  This configuration could consist of:\r\n   1. Versions of packages available in the Spack repo\r\n   2. Various `packages.yaml` files\r\n\r\n1. *Project*: A set of configuration files affecting concretization, that have been designated as a \"project\" by the user.  The actual files are the same as for a platform; but their content will affect specific package verisons, etc. rather than system-level stuff (such as which version of MPI is already installed and should be used).\r\n\r\n-------------\r\n\r\nWhen installing against the \"set of already-installed packages\", it makes most sense to do so with respect to a package list, derived ultimately from an environment spec.  Users mostly want to be protected against a change in platform (i.e. new versions require new rebuilds just because you upgraded Spack).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
