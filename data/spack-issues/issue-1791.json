    "body": "Hello!\n\nI am hoping to be able to do something like this:\n\n``` bash\n./bin/spack repo add /path/to/site-repo\n./bin/spack create -r site-repo https://internal.gitlab/coolpackage-1.2.3tgz\n```\n\nBut the create command fails with this message:\n\n```\n==> Error: No repo.yaml found in 'site-repo'\n```\n\nHowever, I would argue that I do in fact have a repo.yaml file in the `/path/to/site-repo` folder with these contents:\n\n``` yaml\nrepo:\n  namespace: 'site-repo'\n```\n\nHowever, if I manually copy a created package into the 'site-repo' folder, I am able to install it just fine.\n",
