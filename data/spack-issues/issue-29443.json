    "body": "Refactors environment view generation\n\n1. Reduce the number of stat calls by a factor 2 to 3\n2. Replace symlinked directories with directories filled with symlinks\n\nSimple tests with `cmake` + `perl` as root specs on a shared filesystem shows\nthat it's about 1.75x than current develop (repeated stat calls hit fs cache,\nso no magic 2x to 3x gains...)\n\nTODO:\n- [ ] raise on merge conflict.\n- [x] don't merge dirs when underlying dir is symlinked outside prefix.\n- [ ] bring back .spack metadata folder.\n- [ ] bring back `add_files_to_view` package pass for Python.\n\n\n",
