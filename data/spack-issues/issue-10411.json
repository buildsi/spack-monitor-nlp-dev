    "body": "Began with @gonsie changing mpifileutils to use cmake.\r\n\r\nImplemented DynamicInheritancePackage build system that can dynamically change its phases and attributes to mirror the other build system classes. The `classes` field is a dictionary of build system classes and anonymous specs describing when they are used.\r\n\r\nPackage classes are responsible for shadowing any dependencies and variants from the build system classes they intend to inherit from.\r\n\r\nmpifileutils provides an example with a package changing from autotools to cmake, including handling the `build_type` variant from `CMakePackage` through the flag_handler method for the earlier versions that use autotools.\r\n\r\n@tgamblin I think you will find this interesting.",
