    "body": "While debugging #8954, I discovered that if you are on a system where `ibv_devices` exists, every time you run a command that touches any `package.py` file, the `openmpi` package tries to run `ibv_devices` to set the default variant value. This is true even if you don't reference any package that depends on `openmpi`. You can see this for yourself by running:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --debug spec zlib\r\n...\r\n==> '/usr/bin/ibv_devices'\r\n...\r\n```\r\nI don't think this is the root cause of #8954, but I also think running this command every time is unnecessary. Convenient, but slow.\r\n\r\nThis has been in place since @eschnett's #973.",
