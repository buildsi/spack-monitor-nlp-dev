    "body": "This was introduced by my PR #579 (now merged)\n\nIf a URL resource was at one time identifiable with a digest, and then the digest was removed from package.py without changing the version, and the resource was altered (i.e. by the maintainer), the caching logic will mistakenly use the old resource from the cache. \n\nTo be clear as long as there is not a transition from a version having an associated digest to having no digest, there will not be a problem. Changing digests will not be an issue.\n\nThis is fairly specific and there are no existing examples of this that I know of, so this isn't my immediate priority but I want to have a PR fix in the next week.\n",
