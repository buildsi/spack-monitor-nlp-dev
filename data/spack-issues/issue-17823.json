It ends up with CUDAHOSTCXX=CC, which is wrong.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output. If there was no error message and no output but the result is incorrect, describe how it does not match what you expect. -->\r\n\r\n```console\r\nCMake Error at /global/u2/v/vanessen/spack.git/opt/spack/cray-cnl7-skylake_avx512/gcc-8.2.0/cmake-3.18.0-esuryqzyhasr24bju42ydqhlnvlvmd4b/share/cmake-3.18/Modules/CMakeDetermineCUDACompiler.cmake:46 (message):\r\n  Could not find compiler set in environment variable CUDAHOSTCXX:\r\n  CC.\r\nCall Stack (most recent call first):\r\n  CMakeLists.txt:264 (enable_language)\r\n```\r\n\r\n```console\r\n[lbann-dev-skylake_avx512] vanessen@cgpu12:~/lbann.git/build/gnu.Release.cgpu.nersc.gov/build> printenv CUDAHOSTCXX\r\nCC\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\nCoriGPU\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue.
