    "body": "Fixes a bug I introduced in #27798. The `-I` and `-L` flags are only valid for the `python setup.py build` phase, not for `python setup.py install`. If I remove these, the resulting installation succeeds, and still RPATHs to libgpuarray, so it looks like they aren't needed. \r\n\r\nAlso fixed some deptypes and removed dependencies that are only needed for unit tests which we don't run.",
