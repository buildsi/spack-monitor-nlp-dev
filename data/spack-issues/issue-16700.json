    "body": "In #15214, the `SPACK_COMPILER_EXTRA_RPATHS` is set to include the `libfabrics` built with Intel MPI.\r\n\r\nWhen using this with `intel-parallel-studio` however, the version check\r\n\r\n```python\r\nif self.version >= ver('2019'):\r\n```\r\n\r\nis always ``False``, because ``self.version`` contains the \"edition\" prefix, e.g. ``cluster.2019.3``. The IntelPackage already has the `version_yearlike` property to deal with this. As such, this can be fixed by simply replacing ``self.version`` with ``self.version_yearlike``.",
