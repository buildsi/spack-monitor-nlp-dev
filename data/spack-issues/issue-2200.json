    "body": "I was testing out Spack by attempting an installation of mvapich2 on my Fedora laptop. Of course, I don't have any libibverbs installed on my laptop, and even with all of the variants disabled, I was unable to build mvapich2:\r\n```\r\nconfigure: error: 'libibverbs not found. Did you specify --with-ib-libpath=?'\r\n```\r\nI could use the system package manager to do this, but how would people feel about a Spack package for libibverbs? It looks like you can download it here:\r\nhttps://www.openfabrics.org/downloads/libibverbs/",
