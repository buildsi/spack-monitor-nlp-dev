Perhaps there is a bug where petsc's build only python dependency:\r\n```\r\n    depends_on('python@2.6:2.8', type='build')\r\n```\r\nis propagated outside of just the build environment?\r\n\r\nEDIT: I guess I didn't search hard enough as this seems to be a known issue:\r\n- https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/7926\r\n- https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/2548\r\n- https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/8018",
