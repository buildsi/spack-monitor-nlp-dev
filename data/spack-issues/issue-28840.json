    "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nAdd support in environments for external configuration files obtained from a URL.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nSpack currently assumes these files reside on the local file system but projects and facilities put a lot of effort into defining standard, or base, configuration files for their systems.  Spack should make it easier to use configuration files from the web.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nConfiguration files obtained from remote repositories should be supported.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.17.1-1109-d4ca803fc5\r\n```\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
