    "body": "I created, concretized and installed a Spack Environment.  `module avail` verified that a bunch of modules had been created.  Then I ran:\r\n```\r\nspack -e myenv env loads -r\r\n```\r\nIt replied:\r\n```\r\nTo load this environment, type:\r\n   source .../spack/var/spack/environments/research/loads\r\n```\r\nThe `loads` file is created, but NOTHING IS IN IT.  This used to work, now it's mysteriously stopped working.  Frustrating.\r\n\r\n",
