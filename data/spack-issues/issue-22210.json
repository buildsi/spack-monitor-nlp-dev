    "body": "There have been a lot of questions and some confusion recently surrounding Spack installation test capabilities so this PR is intended to clean up and refine the documentation for \"Checking an installation\".\r\n\r\nIt aims to better distinguish between checks that are performed during an installation (i.e., build-time tests) and those that can be done days and weeks after the software has been installed (i.e., install (or smoke) tests).\r\n\r\nI am  also adding more links and examples.\r\n\r\nUPDATE: The output associated with the ``OpenMPI`` stand-alone/smoke tests reflects the updates/bugfixes from #23276 .",
