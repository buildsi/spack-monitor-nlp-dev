    "body": "Fixes a bug I introduced in #27798. Before #27798, we ran:\r\n```console\r\n$ python setup.py build -j4\r\n$ python setup.py install ...\r\n```\r\nAfter #27798, we now run `pip install .` which runs:\r\n```console\r\n$ python setup.py install -j4 ...\r\n```\r\nHowever, the `-j` flag is apparently only valid for the build phase, not for the install phase. Removed the flag and now `py-astropy` successfully installs for me.",
