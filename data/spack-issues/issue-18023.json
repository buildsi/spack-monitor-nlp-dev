    "body": "Can we change the way CI Job's are labeled so that the Spec name/version/hash are featured more prominently? \r\n\r\nJobs are currently labeled like this:\r\n* `(specs) autoconf/cyewtpk 2.69 intel@19.1.1.217 cray-cnl7-haswell`\r\n\r\nGitLab only shows the first 13 characters of this by default, and you have to mouse-over to see the full label. So `(specs)` takes up 7/13 (>50%) of the label, when it is arguably the least important aspect of the label. This leads to all the job labels rendering as:\r\n* `(specs) autoco` (you have to mouse over to see the whole label)\r\n\r\nIf we just move the `(specs)` designator to the end of the job, like this: \r\n* `autoconf/cyewtpk 2.69 intel@19.1.1.217 cray-cnl7-haswell (specs)`\r\n\r\nThe jobs are shortened in a way that preserves the more relevant portions of the label:\r\n* `autoconf/cyew`\r\n\r\n@scottwittenburg",
