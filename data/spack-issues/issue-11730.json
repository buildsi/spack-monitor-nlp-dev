    "body": "@citibeth @neilflood I decided to add PROJ.6 to Spack. As you probably know, the PROJ.6 API is not backwards compatible with PROJ.5 and PROJ.4. I updated several packages that depend on `proj` to account for this (in followup PRs), but if you could test other packages for me that would be great.\r\n\r\nPackages that depend on `proj` that may need to be updated due to PROJ.6:\r\n\r\n- [x] cdo (#11758)\r\n- [x] gdal (#11733)\r\n- [x] gdl (#11760)\r\n- [x] gplates (#11761)\r\n- [x] grass (#11762)\r\n- [x] ibmisc (#11753)\r\n- [x] libgeotiff (#11731)\r\n- [x] libspatialite (#11752)\r\n- [x] magics (#11763)\r\n- [x] mapserver (#11764)\r\n- [x] pism (#11754)\r\n- [x] py-cartopy (#11765)\r\n- [x] py-pyproj (#11735)\r\n- [x] r-rgdal (#11766)\r\n- [x] r-sf (#11767)\r\n- [x] saga-gis (#11768)",
