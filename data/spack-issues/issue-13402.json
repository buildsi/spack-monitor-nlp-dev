    "body": "Turns out a patch for #13231 has been available in the bison mailing list archives. I did a few test builds and the patch seems to fix the problem for me. I am not sure whether the added dependencies make it worth it, though (most of them are already required by bison anyway). @adamjstewart\r\n\r\nI will send feedback to the developers to make sure it gets included in the next release.",
