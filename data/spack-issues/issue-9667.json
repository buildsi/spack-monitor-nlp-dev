    "body": "py-llvmlite has an issue with the dependencies.  The relevant line in package.py is\r\n```python\r\ndepends_on('llvm@6.0:', when='@0.23.0:')\r\n```\r\nNote the colon after the version number.  Spack will install anything newer than 6.0 and 7.0.0 is now available.  However, the setup.py file in py-llvmlite code insists on major version 6.  The simple solution is to just change the version in the depends_on() call to \"6.0.1\" (without the colon).  We might also want to check and see if a newer version of llvmlite exists that works with LLVM 7.x\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install py-llvmlite\r\n```\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Error: ProcessError: Command exited with status 1:\r\n    '/home/xmr/git/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-8.2.0/python-3.7.0-s5za75wfhglupziwnnwnnjq6ek7nlwef/bin/python3.7' '-s' 'setup.py' '--no-user-cfg' 'build'\r\n\r\n1 error found in build log:\r\n     13        main_posix('linux', '.so')\r\n     14      File \"/tmp/xmr/spack-stage/spack-stage-hQ1bbv/llvmlite-0.23.0/ffi/build.py\",\r\n            line 105, in main_posix\r\n     15        raise RuntimeError(msg)\r\n     16    RuntimeError: Building llvmlite requires LLVM 6.0.x.
