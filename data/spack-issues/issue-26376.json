    "body": "Since I have to polish the `ArchSpec.from_dict` method for #26264 I took some time to go through other methods of the same class and do a cleanup there as well.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] Remove code in `ArchSpec.from_dict` to be compatible with Spack v0.9.X\r\n- [x] Simplified `ArchSpec.copy` by avoiding calling `__new__` and `_dup`\r\n- [x] Reworked `ArchSpec.__repr__` to be more compliant with Python idioms",
