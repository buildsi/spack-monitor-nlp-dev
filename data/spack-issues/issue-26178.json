Closes #20349.\r\nPreviously a runtime error would claiming that netcdf-c was not compiled with MPI support (even if it was specifically requested) \r\n\r\n`ValueError: parallel mode requires MPI enabled netcdf-c\r\n`\r\nThe setup.py checks for parallel support by trying to import mpi4py, so it is added as a dependency.\r\n",
