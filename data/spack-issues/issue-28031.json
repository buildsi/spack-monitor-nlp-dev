    "body": "Not sure if this is the goal, but this PR provides a meaningful error message before terminating the `spack install` of an empty environment.  Without this change, \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack install\r\n==> Error: list index out of range\r\n```\r\n\r\nwith the change, a ~an error~ message about no specs is output before ~terminating~ calling the code to regenerate the view:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack install\r\n==> <env-name> environment has no specs to install\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe reason for terminating is because we do that if no specs are provided on the command line.  If that is not the desired behavior, this PR can be changed.",
