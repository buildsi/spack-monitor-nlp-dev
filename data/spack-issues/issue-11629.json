    "body": "Temporary fix to #11628.\r\n\r\nI think a more permanent fix would be something along the lines of:\r\n- write at least one virtual package, call the 1st one `ninja-build`\r\n- if it's possible, give `ninja-build` a `+fortran` variant, if not, have a 2nd virtual package called `ninja-build-fortran`\r\n- have `ninja` and `ninja-fortran` provide the appropriate virtual packages",
