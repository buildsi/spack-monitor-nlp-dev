    "body": "I am getting a rather vague error message when attempting to build cntk with spack (gitrev: bb29ec1) on ORNL Titan. The following is the output that I am getting from spack:\r\n\r\n> titan-ext2: ./bin/spack install cntk %gcc@4.9.3 \r\n> titan-ext2: ==> Error: 'shared'\r\n\r\nThis error message appears irregardless of what node type I attempt to compile on (login, service, and compute all show the same error) and it only appears with cntk (other packages compile/install without issue). \r\n\r\nWhat exactly is this error message indicating and what would I need to do to sidestep this problem?",
