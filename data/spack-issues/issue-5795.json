    "body": "If you wish to construct a package with multiple active development versions, you're forced into awkward dependency semantics for any changed dependencies. Where you would ordinarily say:\r\n```\r\ndepends_on(old_dep_spec, when=@:last_old_version)\r\ndepends_on(new_dep_spec, when=@first_new_version:)\r\n```\r\nyou now must say:\r\n```\r\ndepends_on(old_dep_spec, when=@0.0.0:last_old_version)\r\ndepends_on(new_dep_spec, when=@first_new_version:@999.999.999)\r\ndepends_on(WIP_dep_spec, when=@develop)\r\ndepends_on(WIP_dep_spec, when=@some_dev_branch)\r\n```\r\nIt would be convenient to have a way to express the following concepts:\r\n\r\n1) Explicit half-open version intervals, rather than repeating nines as a hack.\r\n2) Named versions may be ordered with respect to each other and with respect to numeric versions\r\n3) \\@develop should be a marker for \"first version of those that are named and successors to all numeric releases\"\r\n\r\nThis allows the above to become:\r\n```\r\ndepends_on(old_dep_spec, when=@:first_new_version)\r\ndepends_on(new_dep_spec, when=@first_new_version:@develop)\r\ndepends_on(WIP_dep_spec, when=@develop:)\r\n```\r\npossibly with an explicit marker for half-open intervals, and allows master and some_dev_branch to be named versions rather than a single variable \\@develop.",
