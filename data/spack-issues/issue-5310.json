    "body": "Adding new package bambam with some edits to samtools and bamtools packages.\r\n\r\nThis bambam package was released March 2016, but it still uses the old file structure of samtools, when include and lib directories were created upon compilation/installation. For this, I have created a variant in the samtools package that gives the user the option to include these directories with their samtools installation. Bambam requires the samtools libraries and headers, and I know I have at least one or two more packages that will be requiring this on my list.\r\n\r\nAs for the bamtools edit, bambam required the libbamtools-util library for compilation, so I added that to the existing bamtools library.\r\n",
