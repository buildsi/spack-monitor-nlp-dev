    "body": "I added a new patch to a spec file and re-ran `spack install`. The previous build had failed, and the leftovers were still present on disk. Spack did not re-apply the patches, and thus didn't detect the new, additional patch.\n\nSpack should detect changes to the Python class (e.g. via a hash, or via storing the Python script in the install directory), and should re-patch packages if there are changes.\n",
