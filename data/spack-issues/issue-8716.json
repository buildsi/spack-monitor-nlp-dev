This problem was solved in #1964 with a post-install patch.  Since then, #3835 came up with a different solution that did not need the post-install patch.  And we all seemed to agree at the time it was a good and elegant solution.\r\n\r\n## The Problem\r\n\r\nUnfortunately... the original problem from #1964 has reared its ugly head again:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[rpfische@gs611-gibbs stieglitz]$ python3 -c 'from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable'\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nImportError: No module named 'mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1'\r\n[rpfische@gs611-gibbs stieglitz]$ python3 -c 'import mpl_toolkits.basemap'\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\n  File \"/home2/rpfische/spack6/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-4.9.3/py-basemap-1.0.7-fpu2nxnadqokntqdzweoinytf6wuu5bx/lib/python3.5/site-packages/mpl_toolkits/basemap/__init__.py\", line 31, in <module>\r\n    from mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1 import make_axes_locatable\r\nImportError: No module named 'mpl_toolkits.axes_grid1'\r\n[rpfische@gs611-gibbs stieglitz]$ python3 --version\r\nPython 3.5.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that I'm running Python by `module loading` a bunch of Spack-generated modules, rather than using `spack activate`.\r\n\r\n## What To Do?\r\n\r\nAny ideas on a way forward?  From my local point of view, it looks like the patch from #1964 actually is required, at least in some cases.\r\n",
