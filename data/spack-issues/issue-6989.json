    "body": "py-basemap was failing to build because py-setuptools was listed as a build dependency, even though it does not use it to build, thus causing the --single-version-externally-managed flag to be erroneously added to the installation via setup.py. py-setuptools is a run-time dependency for py-basemap per #3813.\r\n\r\nThis PR sets py-setuptools as only a run dependency in py-basemap. It also modifies the Python package build system to only supply the --single-version-externally-managed flag for build-time dependences of py-setuptools.",
