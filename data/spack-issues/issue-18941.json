    "body": "\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nDue to [known issues with the concretizer](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/known_issues.html#variants-are-not-properly-forwarded-to-dependencies) I'm almost always checking what spack is going to do with `spack spec -I <spec>` before `spack install <spec>`, in case I need to add an installed dependency by hash.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n From working with [Unix](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/make.1.html)  [tools](https://linux.die.net/man/1/rsync), my intuition would actually be to type `spack install --dry-run <spec> ` or `spack install -n <spec>` to get the functionality of `spack spec -I`. Unfortunately `install -n` is already taken. \r\n\r\nThis would just cut down the number of keystrokes needed to install and make for a better user experience. \r\n\r\nAllowing flags after the spec, like `spack install <spec> -n` would also help here, but that may be a different issue, and probably trickier, as `-` is still used for variants.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nCurrent as of:\r\n```\r\n~/spack (develop)$ spack --version\r\n0.15.4-1137-6ec3c4d\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n",
