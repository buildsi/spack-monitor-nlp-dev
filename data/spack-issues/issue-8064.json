    "body": "Addresses #4811. Note the actual PATH on linux should be `bin/x86_64-linux`. It appears to be in reversed in that issue.\r\n\r\nTo be honest I haven't had a chance to test this because it seems like something is out of sync with the texlive CTAN servers or whatever. I did test it on another package though and it does what I want. I get this error on all systems I've tried when installing texlive today:\r\n```\r\n./install-tl: The TeX Live versions of the local installation\r\nand the repository being accessed are not compatible:\r\n      local: 2017\r\n repository: 2018\r\nPerhaps you need to use a different CTAN mirror?\r\n```",
