    "body": "`openblas` really drives me nuts. Apparently, the solution of this PR https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/751 was not enough. It seems that if the fortran compiler is not in the path (i.e. build by Spack and is used as `f77: /path/to/spack/opt/spack/darwin-x86_64/clang-7.3.0-apple/gcc-5.3.0-ctakkbfikm76kcnssbb3gv53mlrwldbl/bin/gfortran`) then `openblas` does not pick it up\n\n```\nOpenBLAS: Detecting fortran compiler failed. Cannot compile LAPACK. Only compile BLAS.\n```\n\nPreviously it seemed to work for me because I had `gfortran` from `homebrew` in path. Now I removed homebrew completely and thereby discovered this issue.\n\nI noticed that `openblas` has `cmake` config, maybe it's time to use that to avoid the buggy make scripts?\n\n@tgamblin ideas?\n",
