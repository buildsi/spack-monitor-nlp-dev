    "body": "Fixes #1874 -- something I've been meaning to do for a long time.\n\n@davydden - can you test this?\nAlso probably of interest to @jgalarowicz.\n- Fixed up dependency management so that:\n  - build deps go in PATH and -I\n  - link deps go in -L args\n  - only _immediate_ link deps are RPATH'd\n\nThe latter reduces the number of libraries that need to be added to\nDT_NEEDED / LC_RPATH.  This removes redundant RPATHs to transitive\ndependencies.\n",
