You can explicitly cause the build to fail from install() by raising an InstallError, for example:\r\n> \r\n> if spec.architecture.startswith('darwin'):\r\n>     raise InstallError('This package does not build on Mac OS X!')\r\n\r\nbut how does spack detect errors in the make, make check make install paradigm. My make failed as did the make install but spack happily goes along thinking the install was successful.\r\n\r\n> make[1]: *** [libpflotran.a] Error 1\r\n> failed building pflotran, libpflotran.a, and/or libpflotranchem.a\r\n> Installing PFLOTRAN at /Users/barrysmith/Src/spack/opt/spack/darwin-sierra-x86_64/clang-8.0.0-apple/pflotran-develop-gbnqbgxs25z4yvzi5fnnxh7spppvv34p.\r\n> cp: /private/var/folders/c1/ldz_dt8n2r3dtwv_chp5pfr40000gn/T/barrysmith/spack-stage/spack-stage-NqfHMU/pflotran-xsdk/src/pflotran/pflotran: No such file or directory\r\n\r\nwhat do I need to do in my makefiles to get spack to realize that the process failed?\r\n\r\nNote this happens with the pflotran package so you can see what the makefile looks like currently.\r\n",
