Unless testutils.generate_output_format only creates XML output for failed/error tests (and excludes passed/skipped) then it will be difficult to make it compatible across 2.6 and 2.7\n\nUsing nose may be a better option (since it provides an XML output option and is cross-compatible) but would require some different edits.\n",
