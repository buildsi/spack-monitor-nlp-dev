    "body": "I think that #1883 broke spack for me. It looks like py-pep8 is in a weird state on my machine. I cannot uninstall it, I get this error `==> Error: Package py-pep8 not found.` but `spack find` shows it is still there. I don't really care except that I can't run `spack module refresh` because I get  `==> Error: Package py-pep8 not found.`\n",
