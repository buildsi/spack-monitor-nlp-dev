    "body": "fixes #18694\r\n\r\nAccording to [Autotools Mythbuster](https://autotools.io/libtool/lafiles.html) libtool archive files are mostly vestigial, but they might create issues when relocating binary packages as shown in #18694. For GCC specifically, most distributions remove these files [with explicit commands](https://git.stg.centos.org/rpms/gcc/blob/master/f/gcc.spec#_1303).\r\n\r\n~Considered all of that, this commit adds an easy way for each `AutotoolsPackage` to remove every .la file that has been installed. The default, for the time being, is to maintain them - to be consistent with what Spack was doing previously.~\r\n\r\nThis PR makes removing `.la` files for all autotools packages the default behavior, and leaves the option to revert to the old behavior on a package by package base.",
