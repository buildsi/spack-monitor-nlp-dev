    "body": "When I was adding NAG compiler support, I wasn't exactly sure how the link_paths dict worked. For NAG, since it doesn't have C and C++ compilers, I set `cc` to point to `cc` and `cxx` to point to `cxx` so Spack would use the default wrappers. I didn't know that it was expecting these symlinks to exist in lib/spack/env.\n\nSo I can either:\n1.  add the symlink, or\n2.  change link_paths in Nag.py to point `cxx` to `c++`\n\nWhich would you prefer?\n",
