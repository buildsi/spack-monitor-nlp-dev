    "body": "This PR involves several major updates to the Contribution Guide:\n- Point to our Contribution Guide from the main Spack README\n- Add documentation on Travis CI and how to run unit, flake8, and documentation tests locally\n- Updates to the Git Workflows (see below)\n\n@davydden Can you take a look at this since you wrote the original Contribution Guide?\n\nI decided to put the instructions on how to run unit tests and flake8 tests above your git workflows in the hopes that people actually run these tests before submitting a PR. I also re-organized your git workflows a bit. I feel like branching and rebasing the \"normal\" way is probably easier for people new to Git than the cherry-pick methods, so I put them before the cherry-pick sections. I added a new section on rebasing with the \"rebase\" command.\n\n@citibeth You would probably be interested in this too. Sorry it's taken me so long to document how to run tests locally. Let me know if there's anything you think is unclear or isn't documented.\n\nP.S. It looks like the diff view is pretty much useless...\n",
