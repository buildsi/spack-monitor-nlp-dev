    "body": "When building on Mac (using default compilers), it is necessary to have Xcode and Command Line tools installed.  Apple unfortunately doesn't make this easy.  If you installed Xcode but not CLT, things will go ahead just fine, but some stuff won't work.\r\n\r\nDuring setup (creating of `compilers.yaml`), Spack should check that Xcode and Command Line Tools are installed; and if not, complain with an error, telling the user how to install the required stuff.  This will be the right thing to do on 99% of Macs.  For the remaining 1%, maybe there should be an override to ignore the error, or have the user create `compilers.yaml` manually.\r\n\r\n",
