    "body": "This mainly addresses problems on `darwin` with MacPorts-built `mpich`.\r\n\r\n1. Fix `Warning: error detecting \"mpich\" from prefix /opt/local/bin [expected str, bytes or os.PathLike object, not NoneType]` by checking whether `spack_compiler.cc` is set before using its value (`Spack` falsely detects `apple-clang` in `/opt/local/bin` that is mixed with `gfortran` but does not have `cc`).\r\n2. Fix the detection of MacPorts-built `gcc`, which has suffix `-mp-10` on my system.\r\n3. Fix incorrect concatenation of a multi-valued variant with a compiler spec (`Warning: error detecting \"mpich\" from prefix /opt/local/bin [invalid values for variant \"device\" in package \"mpich\": ['ch4%gcc@10.3.0']`)",
