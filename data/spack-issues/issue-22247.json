    "body": "This PR tries to reorganize how we run tests to:\r\n1. Run less tests in PRs that modify only package recipes\r\n2. Introduce dependencies between tests, so that fast tests passing are a prerequisite to run slow tests\r\n\r\nto counter the raise in the waiting time seen in the last few days for PRs to start running on Github Actions. \r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] Both linux and MacOS unit tests are in the same workflow, and are conditional on style tests passing\r\n- [x] PRs that change only package files skip running slow tests and avoid submitting coverage\r\n- [x] MacOS unit tests fail fast (exit on first error)\r\n\r\nRelevant links:\r\n- https://github.community/t/how-do-i-specify-job-dependency-running-in-another-workflow/16482/15\r\n- https://github.community/t/feature-request-conditional-required-checks/16761/21",
