    "body": "A useful package, but based on python 2.\r\n\r\nFour issues of note:\r\n  1. I copied numpy's `set_blas_lapack` function.  It would be great if I could call it directly instead.\r\n  2. I had to work around the \"--single-version-externally-managed\" build flag added by spack.\r\n  3. I had to create a patch to remove a \"refs\" data-element cython didn't like (package-specific)\r\n  4. I detest flake8. There is nothing wrong with my typing, and I refuse to let a machine tell me otherwise.\r\n",
