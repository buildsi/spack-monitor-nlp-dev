    "body": "Tests run on MacOS are failing since Wed. June 10th. More in details, there has been a sudden increase in the time it takes to run the tests and the consistent failure of a single lock test (`test_lock_debug_output`). \r\n\r\nThis PR doesn't solve the issue, which still needs investigation, but at least it makes the CI pass by skipping the failing test. Further information:\r\n\r\n- It seems the MacOS runner has been updated from the `19F96` update of MacOS 10.15.5 to the `19F101` update at the same time we started seeing the failure (so there might be some correlation)\r\n- Under the same OS and update the failure cannot be reproduced locally (e.g. it can't be reproduced on a Mac Book with MacOS 10.15.5 (19F101))\r\n\r\n",
