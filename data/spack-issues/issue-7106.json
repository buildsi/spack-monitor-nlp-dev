    "body": "This patch adds the 'intel-xed' package, the Intel X86 Encoder Decoder\r\nlibrary for encoding and decoding x86 machine instructions.\r\n\r\nXED was previously closed source inside Intel, but is now available on\r\nGitHub (yeah!) at github.com/intelxed.\r\n\r\nXED homepage: https://intelxed.github.io/\r\n\r\nThere is one small point I was unsure how to do.  XED only runs on\r\nx86.  It won't even build on powerpc.\r\n\r\nI'm guessing you'd want to handle this by adding a conflict().\r\nI want to say, conflict('arch != x86'), but I was unsure of the\r\ncorrect syntax for that.\r\n\r\nThis is probably a 1-line change, if someone can show me what the\r\ncorrect spec for that is.\r\n\r\nMark Krentel\r\n",
