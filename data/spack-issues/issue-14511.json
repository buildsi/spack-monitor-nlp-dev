    "body": "*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nIf spack is configured to use a repository with buildcache, and spack tries to install a package that is not in buildcache, the output is flooded with 404 errors when spack tries to download missing specks. E.g.: https://gist.github.com/iarspider/59c32adc9242a0a5355625bd34e2794a\r\n\r\nAll the 404 messages are only useful to a \"buildcache maintainer\", not to a \"buildcache user\". Can these be suppressed by default, and only shown if  \"verbose\" flag is passed to \"spack install\"?\r\n",
