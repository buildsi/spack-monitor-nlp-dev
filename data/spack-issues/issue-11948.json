    "body": "By default, jsoncpp will build and execute tests during its build process. This fails on some platforms that use cross-compiling (i.e. compilers used by spack are actually wrappers for cross-compiling to the target hardware). This PR adds `-DJSONCPP_WITH_TESTS=OFF` so that jsoncpp doesn't build its tests.",
