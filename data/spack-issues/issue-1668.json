    "body": "Adds a package for [PNGwriter](https://github.com/pngwriter/pngwriter/), a simple high-level C++ png API used in scientific projects.\n\n```\nPNGwriter is a very easy to use open source graphics library that\nuses PNG as its output format. The interface has been designed to be\nas simple and intuitive as possible. It supports plotting and reading\npixels in the RGB (red, green, blue), HSV (hue, saturation,\nvalue/brightness) and CMYK (cyan, magenta, yellow, black) colour\nspaces, basic shapes, scaling, bilinear interpolation, full TrueType\nantialiased and rotated text support, bezier curves, opening existing\nPNG images and more.\n```\n\nPNGwriter is a dependency for [PIConGPU](http://picongpu.hzdr.de), an open-source, many-core, fully-relativistic particle-in-cell code and further software developed at [Helmholz-Zentrum Dresden - Rossendorf](https://www.hzdr.de).\n### Dependency Graph\n\n``` bash\n$ spack graph pngwriter\no  pngwriter\n|\\\n| |\\\n| | |\\\n| | o |  freetype\n| |/ /\n| o |  libpng\n|/ /\no |  zlib\n /\no  cmake\n\n$ spack graph --concretize pngwriter\no  pngwriter\n|\\\n| |\\\n| | |\\\n| | | o  cmake\n| | | |\\\n| | | o |  openssl\n| |_|/ /\n|/| | | \n| | o |  freetype\n| |/ /\n| o |  libpng\n|/ /\no |  zlib\n /\no  ncurses\n```\n",
