    "body": "@davydden @tgamblin \nThis Issue is related to: #1924 #1940 #1561 \n\nCurrently, the `@develop` version is special, in that it is larger than all numeric versions, whereas all other non-numeric versions are smaller.  Although this does serve a purpose, it feels like a special-case \"hack\" where a more general (and transparent) approach could serve us better.  This is a proposal for comparing versions that is more general.\n\nA version consists of a series of strings separated by dots.  For example: '1', '1.2', 'master', '1.2.develop', etc.  Versions are compared by:\n1. Split on the dots.  Eg: '1.2.develop' --> ('1', '2', 'develop')\n2. Compare the tuples element-by-element using the following rules:\n   a) An element is numeric if it consists of all 0-9 digits (plus other stuff, like 2a).\n   b) Any element starting '<' is always less than 0; any element starting with '>' is greater than 9.\n   c) All other elements will be sorted in alphabetical order, and placed less than elements starting with '<'\n\nIn practice, two things would need to change from current use:\n1. Replace '@develop' with '@>develop'\n2. Use quotes when specifying these versions in the bash shell.  (Unless we think of different symbols to use for < and >.  The symbols can be more than one character if we like.  Maybe '~' and '+' since those are already used elsewhere in Spack).\n\nThoughts?\n\n[This proposal has been updated slightly from original]\n",
