    "body": "Allow specifying whether AVX2 or AVX512 should be enabled or disabled\r\non x86 targets.\r\n\r\nAs AVX2 hardware and toolchain support is quite ubiquitous by now,\r\nAVX2 is enabled by default.  Also AVX2 support is not disabled when\r\nbuilding the +virtual_machine variant.\r\n\r\nAVX512 is not supported in older but still supported toolchains,\r\nhardware is still expensive, and OpenBLAS AVX512 kernels still have\r\nbugs. Thus AVX512 is disabled by default.",
