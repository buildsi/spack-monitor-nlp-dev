    "body": "During the installation of CMake (actually dealii but in the intermediate step) I get the following error: \r\n```\r\nError: Command exited with status 9:\r\n'./bootstrap' '--prefix=/Users/mathiasmentler/Documents/spack/opt/spack/darwin-sierra-x86_64/gcc-6.2.0/cmake-3.6.1-j2wwd3jknj27v6vgxt6amc2pssul52fj' '--parallel=4' '--no-system-jsoncpp' '--system-libs' '--no-qt-gui' '--' '-DCMAKE_USE_OPENSSL=ON'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI am sitting on MacOS Sierra 10.12.1, have the command-line-tools installed and updated, updated XCode to version 8.1 and tried installing with clang (8.0.0) and gcc (6.2.0), both to no avail. I also tried installing CMake versions 3.6.0 and 3.5.2 and got the same error. In the `spack-build.out` file (which is attached) I get a ton of errors along the lines of something like:\r\n```\r\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.12.sdk/System/Library/Frameworks/CoreFoundation.framework/Headers/CFURL.h:1066:60: error: 'introduced' was not declared in this scope\r\n```\r\nI also attached the `cmake-bootstrap.log`.\r\n\r\nThanks in advance\r\n\r\nMathias\r\n\r\n[cmake_bootstrap.log.txt](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/592374/cmake_bootstrap.log.txt)\r\n[spack-build.out.txt](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/592375/spack-build.out.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
