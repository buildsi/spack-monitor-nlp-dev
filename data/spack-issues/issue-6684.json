    "body": "Fixes #6200\r\n\r\nFor compilers that successfully run a version detection script but don't actually return a version (i.e. an empty string), Spack was keeping track of the empty version and then failing when attempting to construct a compiler spec. This skips any attempt to add a compiler entry when no version is reported (but logs when a compiler fails to report a version).",
