    "body": "Scotch has two flags for integers : for indices (IDXSIZE32/IDXSIZE64) and for sizes (INTSIZE32/INTSIZE64). When compiling for 32bits (no int64 flag), the index size was forced to IDXSIZE64. This PR corrects this behavior.\r\n\r\nNote : maybe it was intended to use **INT**SIZE32 but still with **IDX**SIZE64. But it seems strange, especially as the default. If this was the case however, please tell me so I can amend the PR to keep the current default behavior, but add an option to force compilation for the **IDX**SIZE32/**INT**SIZE32 set of flags.",
