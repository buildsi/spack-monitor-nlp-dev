    "body": "I have the following situation:\n1. `py-scipy` seems to require `binutils@2.26` to build.\n\n```\n        depends_on('binutils@2.26:', type='build')\n```\n1. `py-pillow` has problems with @2.26, it seems to required `binutils@:2.25` to build.\n\n```\n    depends_on('binutils@:2.25', type='build')   # Doesn't work with 2.26\n```\n\nThis should cause no problem because these are build-only dependencies.  However, Spack barfs on it:\n\n```\n$ spack spec py-giss\nInput spec\n------------------------------\n  py-giss\n\nNormalized\n------------------------------\n==> Error: Invalid spec: 'binutils@2.26:^bison^flex^m4'. Package binutils requires version :2.25, but spec asked for 2.26:\n```\n",
