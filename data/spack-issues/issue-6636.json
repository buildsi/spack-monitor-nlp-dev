    "body": "I had to provide two patches for this. One to fix the CMakeLists to enable a missing binary and installing of binaries. The second patch fixes a header to add a missing include and to fix a preprocessor error.\r\n\r\nPercept requires `boost+exception` but that variant did not exist and I am not sure how to enable `boost+exception` besides putting it in the default libs.",
