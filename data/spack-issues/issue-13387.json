    "body": "Many commands relating to Spack Environments don't respect the `--color=never` flag. This is important when the output of your build is going to a qsub log or a pager, where you don't want color code characters.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --color=never concretize 2> err.txt\r\n==> Updating view at /Users/Adam/.spack/darwin/.spack-env/view\r\n$ vim err.txt\r\n==> Warning: ^[[0;95m[^[[0m/mnt/a/u/sciteam/stewart1/crop_classification/.spack-env/view^[[0;95m]^[[0m Skipping external package: cuda@9.1.85%gcc@5.3.0 arch=cray-cnl5-interlagos/lil2nud\r\n```\r\n\r\nMost commands that directly use `tty.color` work, but it looks like some of the Environments commands roll their own color handling, which causes this issue.",
