    "body": "Fixes for a few bugs identified recently.\r\n\r\n*Text not relocating as described here\r\n#6418\r\n\r\nThis was caused by passing a regular expression to filter_file. Passing a literal string for old and new install paths works. Added a test to make sure it works.\r\n\r\nBinary files identified by file with \"dynamically linked\" were being skipped by a check for \"link\" in file type. Changed the check to \"link to\" to cover symbolic links.\r\n\r\nfiles ending in ~ are removed by filter_file(backup=False) but the files might end up in the text to relocate list is filter_file() is called during install\r\n",
