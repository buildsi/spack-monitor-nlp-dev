    "body": "Attending the tutorial at the SC17, I had to create a dockerfile for it.\r\n\r\nWith this one can play around with spack on a (non-Linux) Laptop. Thus nice for tutorial.\r\nBut also nice to create the same output. The resulting install-directory could be extracted and put everywhere.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, by using multi-step builds it could be introduced to other Docker images.\r\nAnd that's just scratching the surface.",
