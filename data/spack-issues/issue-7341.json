    "body": "I am trying to build openmpi with a clang compiler, but the `libsigsegv` library fails due to an ld failure.  I would like to try using a binutils already built with spack.\r\n\r\nWhat is the best way to make it use a specific binutils?  Inject a dependency?  Add a PATH?\r\n\r\nI tried adding this in the compiler\r\n```\r\ncompiler:\r\n    environment: {PATH=.../spack/opt/spack/linux-rhel6-x86_64/gcc-4.9.2/binutils.../bin}\r\n    extra_rpaths: [/projects/alegra/gcc492/lib64]\r\n    flags: {}\r\n```\r\nBut that didn't seem to work.\r\n\r\nI am running on RHEL6.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
