    "body": "This is a workaround for #2321 \r\nTo summarize, the problem was:\r\n 1. `libssh2` was not listed as a dependency, and it should have been.  This causes recent versions of `curl` to not build on machines with an older system-supplied `libssh2`.\r\n 2. Adding `libssh2` created a circular dependency.\r\n\r\nThe workaround for now is to remove newer versions of `curl` until #2321 can be addressed.\r\n",
