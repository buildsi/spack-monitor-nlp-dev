    "body": "A common annoyance on the Spack mailing list has been this scenario:\r\n 1. Alice reports a problem building\r\n 2. Bob asks them to share their `spack-build.out` file.\r\n 3. Alice does so, attaching it to an email message or GitHub Issue comment.\r\n 4. Bob cannot just click on the resulting file in email to view it, because desktop applications (and GMail too) don't know what application to launch of `.out` files.\r\n\r\nNow, Bob has to spend more time downloading the file and opening it in an editor, than how long it might take them to spot the problem.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves that problem by simply calling the file `spack-build.txt` instead.  That will make everybody's lives a little easier; and I can see no downside to it.",
