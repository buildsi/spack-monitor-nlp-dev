    "body": "GitLab instances have different rules for creating their build paths, which can create a lot of confusion when people encounter the `SbangPathError`.  It's easy for people to confuse or conflate the platform-specific `shebang_limit` with`config:install_tree:padded_length`.\r\n\r\nThis PR simply adds the length (and path) to the exception message to provide a quick way for people performing CI to debug their issue.  It includes a new unit test as well.\r\n\r\nThe fully qualified path for the `sbang` script is included since it can help people determine how paths are constructed for a given CI instance, for example.  Having this information has proven useful on at least one ECP CI instance.\r\n\r\nFor example, the error in the unit test is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nInstall tree root is too long. Spack cannot patch shebang lines when script path length (138) exceeds limit (127).\r\n   /tmp/dahlgren/pytest-of-dahlgren/pytest-0/test_install_sbang_too_long0/eeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee/bin/sbang\r\n```\r\n\r\n@shahzebsiddiqui ",
