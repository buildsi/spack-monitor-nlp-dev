    "body": "Dear Developers,\r\n\r\nI am part of PandaRoot team seeking to use PyTorch for ML projects. We usually use Conda to use PyTorch. I have tried to install PyTorch 1.8.2 LTS on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS on PC but I failed many times with different specs. All I need is minimal package with Cuda support just like we get it on Conda. \r\n\r\nMain purpose is to get a `spec` so we can build it along with PandaRoot. I first tried it independently on my laptop. \r\n\r\nMy question is what will be the `spec` or the variants I should try to just get pure PyTorch with Cuda 10.2? Surely someone has tested if everything is working fine. Some of my failed attempts are the following:\r\n\r\n`spack install py-torch@1.8.2+cuda~caffe2~valgrind ^cuda@10.2. 89`\r\n\r\n`spack install py-torch@1.8.2+cuda~caffe2~valgrind~openmp ^cuda@10.2. 89`\r\n\r\nMoreover, isn't it a good idea to add a Readme to help new comers to successfully install PyTorch using Spack? \r\n\r\nBest Regards, ",
