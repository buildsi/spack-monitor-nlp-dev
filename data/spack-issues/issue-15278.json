    "body": "Add version info for kallisto@0.46.2.\r\n\r\nVersions of kallisto since 0.44.0 vendor a copy of htslib and kallisto's cmake bits generate a configure script for it using the auto* tools.  The std cmake args include `-DCMAKE_VERBOSE_MAKEFILE:BOOL=ON`, which causes bits of the cmake verbose output to be embedded in the configure script.  This, in turn, wreaks havoc.\r\n\r\nSee  https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/15274 and https://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto/issues/253 for additional details.\r\n\r\nCloses #15274 ",
