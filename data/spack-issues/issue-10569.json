    "body": "Spack supported versions of fmt default to C++11 for versions less than 5, C++14 greater than 5, with fmt implementing fallbacks to whatever compiler supports.\r\n\r\nTo give better ABI compatibility and use of newer standards, provide a `cxxstd` variant defaulting to 11 with 98-17 options. Use `cmake_args` to set CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD as appropriate, plus use of `FMT_USE_CPP11` option for C++98 builds. Use `conflicts` to disable use of certain standards in versions that don't support, or fail the build, with those standards.\r\n\r\nAdd patches to unify use of `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` in 3.0 versions, remove hard-coding of compiler flags in `fmt-config.cmake`, and prevent use of C++11 features in 4.1.0 when in supported C++98 mode.\r\n\r\nDefault to not building documents as no dependency on Doxygen is yet present, and they are not part of the \"all\" build.",
