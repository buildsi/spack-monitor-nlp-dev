    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\n`gcc` takes much longer to build when `+bootstrap` is enabled. Since `gcc languages=jit` must be built to provide e.g. `libgccjit`, any user of `libgccjit` has to wait for gcc to build itself three times instead of two.\r\n\r\nIs there any security concern to doing this?\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n- Default the `bootstrap` variant of `gcc` to `False`.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n`spack install gcc` is faster!",
