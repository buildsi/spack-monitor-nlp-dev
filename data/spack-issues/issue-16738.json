    "body": "julia fails to build with CMake >= 3.12 because its built-in LLVM 8.0.1 uses FindPythonInterp, which has been deprecated. (similar to #11579)\r\nThis PR limits CMake to <= 3.11 when building Julia <= 1.4.x. Julia master branch uses LLVM 10 which has fixed this problem so the fix shouldn't be needed in future releases.",
