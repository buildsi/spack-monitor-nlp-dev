    "body": "This PR:\r\n\r\n- Adds DAG scheduling (using \"needs\" instead of \"dependencies\" in yaml)\r\n- Jobs expose and consume buildcache artifacts more specifically, when enabled\r\n- Removes extra step of pushing generated yaml as a commit, in favor of dynamic child pipelines\r\n- Adds support for embedding `$padding` in `config/install_tree`\r\n\r\nIn order to re-trigger gitlab pipelines using the correct access token, I needed to close the previous PR (#16027) and open a new one.",
