    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nsupport for URLs in `repos.yaml` would be awesome, e.g. to share development previous of new spack packages/recipes in repos where still a few fixes are needed in the build system before they can be contributed to spack's mainline.\r\n\r\nI found already a note in the docs on this feature: http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/repositories.html#repos-yaml\r\n\r\n> Currently, Spack can only use repositories in the file system. We plan to eventually support URLs in repos.yaml, so that you can easily point to remote package repositories, but that is not yet implemented.\r\n\r\nBut since there is not issue for it yet I opened this one to document the wish :)",
