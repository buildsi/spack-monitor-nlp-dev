    "body": "Spack fails to build qt during a \"spack install py-pyqt4\" attempt. This was brought up in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/12479. Note that I incorrectly said in that PR that it was py-pyqt5 I was trying to build, but in fact it is py-pyqt4 that fails for me. The build log is attached.\r\n\r\n[spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/3522345/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\n@Sinan81 it sounds like you know how to fix this.\r\n",
