    "body": "From installation issue #26369 it appears that dos2unix does not set the proper link flags.\r\nFollowing dos2unix Makefile from Erwin Waterlander, the variable LDFLAGS_USER is set to ensure that\r\n`gettext` adequate link flags are set.\r\nThis solves the isssue for all tested platforms (Ubuntu 18, 20, 21, CentOS 7.8 and 7.9, Rasp Pi Ubuntu 20).\r\nI would be pleased to have a review from @adamjstewart who has been the regular contributor to this package.\r\nI added myseld as a maintainer, as the spack bot suggests.\r\nI also added a new release, both releases were concerned by the link issue.",
