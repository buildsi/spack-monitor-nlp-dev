Setting the variable to a default value in the Jenkins script solves the problem, but it would be great not to have to do that manually.\r\nThe problem is only happening with the new released version (v0.14.1), until then I never had this problem. Also, I found that some servers do still find a way to set the $TERM variable, but on Piz Daint for example it is not working.\r\n\r\nThanks a lot in advance for any answer\r\n\r\n",
