    "body": "I'd like to uninstall all packages for a specific architecture. I just upgraded macOS from Mojave to Catalina, installed a number of new packages under Catalina, and now the old Mojave packages are getting in the way. Ideally, I'd like to just say `spack uninstall arch=darwin-mojave-x86_64` and get rid of all of them. I imagine a similar option would be helpful for removing everything built with a specific\u00a0compiler version.  ",
