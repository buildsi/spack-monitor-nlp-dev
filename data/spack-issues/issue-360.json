    "body": "New features:\n- Changed architecture syntax from '=<arch>' to ' arch=<arch>'. \n      - variants can be specified by 'name=value' as well, supporting arbitary values\n- Compiler flags can be specified from the command line with the same syntax\n      - cflags=<value>\n      - cxxflags=<value>\n      - fflags=<value>\n      - ldflags=<value>\n      - ldlibs=<value>\n      - cppflags=<value>\n      - values must be escape-quoted (spack install foo cflags=\\\"-O1 -ansi\\\") on the command line\n          - they can be normally quoted from within python\n- Compiler flags can also be specified from the compiler config file.\n      - These defaults will be applied to every package using that compiler\n      - The same five flags are supported\n      - The syntax is the same as for compiler paths (flag: value)\n- Variants no longer have to be boolean.\n      - specified by name=<value> on command line\n      - if the value is a string 'True' of 'false' (any capitalization) that is a synonym for the current syntax\n      - the existing syntax will still work.\n- Specs can be referenced by hash\n      - Hashes are prefaced by the '/' symbol\n          - E.G. `spack uninstall /phrk`\n      - The length of the hash reference doesn't matter\n          - If it's long enough to specify a single spec, it will work.\n- Find command can search \"anonymous\" specs\n      - spack find %gcc will return all specs built with gcc\n      - Works with all parameters\n- Added -f option to spack find command\n      - This option prints specs including user supplied compiler flags\n      - Includes flags from both command line and config file.\n",
