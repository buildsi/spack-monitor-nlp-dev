    "body": "Per discussion with @psakievich\r\n- Add `+exodus~fortran` conflict  (before #25549 building `+exodus~fortran` would secretly enable Fortran)\r\n- Enable vendored trilinos gtest package when `self.run_tests` for trilinos developers\r\n\r\nI also:\r\n- reordered some of the conflicts/deps in a separate commit to make them easier to find.\r\n- removed the `zlib` variant in favor of always enabling GZIP compression in Zoltan when that package is enabled (there's such a thing as too-fine granularity in package options...)",
