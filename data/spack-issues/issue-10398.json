    "body": "This is likely more of an issue with LMOD than spack, but i wanted to ask how 'the pros' do it, who have far more experience than I do using Spack and LMOD in a multiuser clustered HPC environment.\r\n\r\nMy last 'release' had a large number of packages. Earlier releases may have slowed down login by 2-4 seconds, but this last (which is 5 times as large, to be sure) takes 15 seconds upon login.\r\n\r\nAnyone have any advice on the best way to troubleshoot where the slowdown might be occurring?",
