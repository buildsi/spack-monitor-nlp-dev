    "body": "The status displayed in the terminal title could be wrong when doing distributed builds. For instance, doing `spack install glib` in two different terminals could lead to the current package being reported as `40/29` due to the way Spack handles retrying locks.\r\n\r\nWork around this by keeping track of the package IDs that were already encountered to avoid counting packages twice.",
