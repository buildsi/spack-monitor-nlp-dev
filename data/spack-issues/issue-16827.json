    "body": "We have a long-standing bug on systems for which the system python does not RPATH its own libraries. This PR fixes that by recording the LD_LIBRARY_PATH at Spack startup and using it to run `sys.executable` when we need python in a subshell.\r\n\r\nThis is refactored from #11989, which was too large in scope.",
