    "body": "Refactored the Legion package to better capture latest configuration and build options.  This includes features that will be necessary for creation of extra packages for other products built on-top of Legion.  Many features now available were driven by new use cases and requirements.   This update deprecates (actually completely removing) our use of the gasnet package.\r\n\r\nAdded package-specific README to assist some users with more details than are easily provided in the inline documentation mechanisms.
