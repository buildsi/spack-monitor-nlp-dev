    "body": "* updated release and checksums\r\n  - I need version 0.4, seems like I ought to include the latest (0.5), and why not include the others while I'm at it (?)\r\n* also tightened `depends_on()` per https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/DT/index.html\r\n\r\nQuestion: the CRAN page above says that `promises` is a dependency.  But it was not previously in this package.py, and `r-promises` doesn't exist in spack.  How is it possible that this worked before then?  \r\n\r\nFYI @hartzell ",
