The new command is\r\nnot as powerful as `spack find --loaded`, as you can't combine it with all the queries or\r\nformats that `spack find` provides.  However, it is more intuitively located in the command\r\nstructure in that it appears in the output of `spack load --help`.\r\n\r\nThe idea here is that people can use `spack load --list`  for simple stuff but fall back to\r\n`spack find --loaded` if they need more.\r\n\r\n- [x] add help to `spack load --list` that references `spack find`\r\n- [x] factor some parts of `spack find` out to be called from `spack load`\r\n- [x] add shell integration\r\n- [x] add shell test\r\n- [x] update completion\r\n- [x] update docs",
