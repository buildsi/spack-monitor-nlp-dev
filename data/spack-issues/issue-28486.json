The spack recipe compensates for the lack of proper cmake support but it's adding the wrong directory as an include target.  \r\n\r\n`find_package` located `/Users/ptb/gitrepos/spack/var/spack/environments/glm-test/.spack-env/view/lib64` as the include directory when it should have been `/Users/ptb/gitrepos/spack/var/spack/environments/glm-test/.spack-env/view/include`\r\n\r\nI plan on submitting a PR that adds a version of glm that tracks the development branch where this upstream problem has been fixed but it would be nice if there were a way to patch things on the spack side for the released versions as well  \n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
