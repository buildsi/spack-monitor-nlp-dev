    "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nHi all, \r\n\r\nI would like to create a docker image and build a set of packages with Spack using a non-default OS compiler. In short, I would like Spack to install a compiler first, add it to a list of compilers and use it to install the rest of a spec. Unfortunately, I can not find an example. \r\n\r\nBuilding Images with Spack is based on the environment concept. However, the concept assumes that a desired compiler has already been installed and added to Spack before an environment is concretized. My question is whether there is a solution for such a problem?\r\n\r\nThe one that I personally found is the following: 1) Create a docker file which is going be based of the Spack builder-image 2) install and add a compiler to Spack inside of my builder-image 3) build the image and use it as my custom builder for the rest of a spec\r\n\r\nHowever, the last part of step 3 would require to use a regular expression in order to find and substitute *FROM **spack/ubuntu-bionic:latest** as builder* to something like *FROM **builder-image:latest** as builder*\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first.
