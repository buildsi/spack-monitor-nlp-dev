    "body": "\u2026while compiling ddparsers\r\n\r\nMore than half of the builds of DD4hep are failing for me because gcc runs out of memory when compiling DDParsers, and I have to restart them with `-j 1`. This is a known issue and the DD4hep developers have added some cmake configuration that basically fixes this problem, but only for the ninja generator: https://github.com/AIDASoft/DD4hep/blob/master/CMakeLists.txt#L65\r\n\r\nSo I'm switching the package recipe to use Ninja - as far as I can tell there are no downsides to this, except for the additional dependency.
