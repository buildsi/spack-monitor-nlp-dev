    "body": "Please change the behavior of `spack list` to do what `spack find` does. Consider adding `spack search` as well.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nTo be more consistent with other open source package managers, the `spack list` command should print out all locally installed packages. Here are the commands from some other package managers:\r\n\r\n| Package Manager      | Community | CLI Tool | Installed Packages        | All Packages |\r\n|----------------------|----------|---------|---------------------------|--------------|\r\n| spack                | HPC       | spack    | find                      | list         |\r\n| homebrew             | Mac       | brew     | list                      | search       |\r\n| MacPorts             | Mac       | port     | installed                 | list, search |\r\n| Pypi                 | Python    | pip      | list                      | search       |\r\n| RubyGems             | Ruby      | gem      | list (--local by default) | list -r      |\r\n| Rust                 | Rust      | cargo    |                           | search       |\r\n| Node Package Manager | NodeJS    | npm      | ls                        | search       |\r\n\r\nNo one *ever* wants a print out of a list that is longer than their terminal buffer. To make the change easier on users, maybe add a `-r/--remote` option to list command to get the original behavior, otherwise, default to `spack find` behavior.",
