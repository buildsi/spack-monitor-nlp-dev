    "body": "On Titan, openblas fails due to the check_build routine.  This is caused by the fact we are cross-compiling and the binary created is not compatible with the login node where spack is running so it fails at the\r\n    make('tests', *self.make_defs)\r\nline in var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/openblas/package.py.  If I remove the line, then spack can proceed.  We need a way to disable these types of tests for machines that cross-compile.  ",
