    "body": "I tried building `glib` on my system but it crashed during configure when it couldn't find `libmount.h`. The `--enable-libmount` option is on by default on Linux only, so it may have problems building on other operating systems. I also couldn't get `util-linux` to build for me with the Intel compilers. For these reasons, I made the dependency an optional variant defaulting to False.",
