    "body": "This change to the ncurses package builds ncurses and ncursesw in two build directories then merges them into one installation. ncurses' headers are superseded by ncursesw's headers, which is the structure I saw in yum's ```ncurses-devel``` package. \r\n\r\nThe yum package also keeps identical copies of the headers in include/ncurses and include/ncursesw. During testing I found hstr expected this structure and added it to the package.\r\n\r\n@davydden How does the ```libs``` function look?\r\n\r\nFixes #3849",
