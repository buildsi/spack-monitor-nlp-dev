(tasn1 is a low-level GNU library)\r\n\r\n* Updates to support proj@6:\r\n  * Updated to grass@7.8.1: for +grass7 because it support proj@6\r\n  * Updated dependency to proj@6, depending on QGIS version (QGIS docs are unclear about which QGIS version is the first to support proj@6)\r\n\r\n* Removed dependency on HDF5.  It's not needed because netcdf-c already depends on HDF5.  Its presence causes concretization errors.\r\n",
