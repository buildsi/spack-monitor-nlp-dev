    "body": "Since a few days we started experiencing errors on most of the unit tests job running on python 2.7. The jobs seem to hang when trying to concretize `mpileaks`:\r\n```console\r\n${coverage_run} bin/spack -p --lines 20 spec mpileaks\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\nGreen light on Travis\r\n\r\n### Actual Result\r\n\r\nThe job errors out after waiting 10 minutes without receiving any output. \r\n\r\n### Notes\r\n\r\n- The error result does not happen consistently, but is indeed very frequent -  it usually takes several restarts to have a job that passes the concretization of `mpileaks`\r\n- The error consistently happen only on python 2.7\r\n- An example of a failing job is [here](https://travis-ci.org/spack/spack/jobs/353413242)",
