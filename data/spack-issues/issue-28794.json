    "body": "GCC and Clang (among others) print the system library search paths that would have been used for compilation when `--print-search-dirs` is passed. `--print-search-dirs` does not take into account `-L` arguments, so Spack dependencies do not appear in the results, which breaks manual library searches in Meson packages.\r\n\r\nThis patch adds a new `search` mode to the Spack compiler wrapper, which acts like `vcheck` but also extends `LIBRARY_PATH` with the library paths of Spack dependencies, thus adding them to the `--print-search-dirs` output.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/20721.",
