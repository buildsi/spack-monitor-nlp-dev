    "body": "Resolves #12156.\r\n\r\nThis moves the Spack tutorial to its own site at spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io, instead of a sub-page on spack.readthedocs.io.\r\n\r\nThis will allow us to version the tutorial independently from Spack.  We will still associate Spack versions with each tutorial instance, but we need to have many tutorials for each Spack version, and we'd like to preserve all the tutorial versions.\r\n\r\nThe new tutorial site is already up and running, and you can see the repo and submit PRs to it at https://github.com/spack/spack-tutorial.\r\n\r\n@hauten: FYI.",
