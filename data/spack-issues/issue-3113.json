    "body": "In order to download from `https://` websites, Spack needs a working `curl`, with a new-enough OpenSSL.  That is not the case on some systems; in that case, Spack must install `curl` itself:\r\n```\r\ncurl@7.52.1%clang@7.3.0-apple arch=darwin-elcapitan-x86_64 \r\n    ^openssl@1.1.0d%clang@7.3.0-apple arch=darwin-elcapitan-x86_64 \r\n        ^perl@5.24.1%clang@7.3.0-apple+cpanm arch=darwin-elcapitan-x86_64 \r\n        ^zlib@1.2.10%clang@7.3.0-apple+pic+shared arch=darwin-elcapitan-x86_64 \r\n```\r\nThe problem would appear if any of those packages requires SSL to download --- then, Spack would be unable to bootstrap a working `curl` if it didn't already have one.  This PR adds comments that discourage authors from changing these four packages to `https://`.\r\n",
