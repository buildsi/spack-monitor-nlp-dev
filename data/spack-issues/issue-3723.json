    "body": "Fixes #3717.\r\n\r\nThe `concretize_compiler_flags` would descend into concrete specs when adding flags to specs looked up by hash.  Concretizer will now ignore these.\r\n\r\nNote: this wasn't a real SHA-1 collision; the hash just wasn't being recomputed because it had been memoized.\r\n\r\n@wscullin: can you verify that this works for you?",
