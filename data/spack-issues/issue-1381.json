    "body": "for now a workaround with MKL is to symlink all libs from `prefix.lib.intel64` to `prefix.lib`. Frankly, i have no idea why by default `prefix.lib` has the following folders:\n\n```\nia32 # symlink to ./ia32_lin\nia32_lin\nintel64 # symlink to ./intel64_lin\nintel64_lin\nintel64_lin_mic # similar to intel64_lin, but somehow fewer number of libs\n```\n\np.s. this is WIP as I am running installation of `deal.II` with MKL and will add fixes if needed.\n\n@lee218llnl ping.\n",
