    "body": "Added the `int64` variant which will build the library using 64-bit integers for certain values.  This gives the capability to have models with more than 2 billion cells and/or nodes.  \r\n\r\nBeginning with CGNS-3.1.0, two new typedef variables have been introduced to support 64-bit mode. The `cglong_t` typedef is always a 64-bit integer, and `cgsize_t` will be either a 32-bit or 64-bit integer depending on how the library was built. Many of the C functions in the MLL have been changed to to use `cgsize_t` instead of `int` in the arguments. These functions include any that may exceed the 2Gb limit of an` int`, e.g. zone dimensions, element data, boundary conditions, and connectivity. In Fortran, all integer data is taken to be `integer*4` for 32-bit and `integer*8` for 64-bit builds.",
