    "body": "When i do spack concretize -f it started showing up with this error.\r\n\r\n==> Error: variant \"header_only\" not found in package \"cgal\"\r\n\r\nI have not seen this error before but only today. I thought of removing cgal but it is one of the dependencies of openfoam. So i will be able to remove it as openfoam install is painfully and takes really longtime . So is there a workaround for this issue. I even tried to install cgal with header on and i get the same error. Is there a way to fix this ?\r\n\r\nthanks",
