    "body": "This work-in-progress pull request adds support for binary packages. It enables the creation of tarballs of build artifacts via e.g.\n\n```\nspack create_tarball libelf\n```\n\nA tarball created that way can be downloaded and installed via\n\n```\nexport SPACK_DOWNLOAD_URL=http://your.own.webserver\nspack install --install-policy download libelf\n```\n\nAt the moment it relies on the dag hash and a platform naming convention to guarantee compatbility between build and install environment. As build and install location may however be different, it contains a placeholder for applying relocation commands. \n\nConsider the current state of the code as a proof-of-principle. I however wanted to share my activities early in the process.\n",
