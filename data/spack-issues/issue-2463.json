    "body": "I believe it's been decided that the `+fpic` variant should be called `+pic` instead.  Someone needs to do a global search-and-replace on the Spack repo to get all packages in line.  Something like:\r\n```\r\nsed -i.bak 's/fpic/pic/g' */package.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nAlso, packages need to be checked, and changed if needed, to follow #2375 ",
