    "body": "**Short story:**\r\n\r\nPyMol package specification had impossible constraint. It was working with old concretizer, but it doesn't work with new one.\r\n\r\n**Long story**:\r\n\r\n`spack install py-pymol` was working in Spack `1.16.3`, but it stopped in `1.17.0`. The commit that breaks it (`git bisect`) is the one that changes default concretizer. `1.17.0` works if the old concretizer is selected.\r\n\r\nConstraint `libpng@1.5.13` is invalid, because there is no such version of `libpng` in Spack packages. \r\n\r\nI checked few versions of Spack back and there was no such version in the past either.\r\n\r\nAll three listed versions of PyMol (`2.5.0`, `2.4.0` and `2.3.0`) seems to be fine without this constraint so I assume it is not needed for it. Also https://pymolwiki.org/index.php/Linux_Install doesn't specify any particular version of `libpng`.\r\n\r\n# Test\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack install py-pymol py-pymol@2.4.0 py-pymol@2.3.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack load py-pymol\r\npymol\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack load py-pymol@2.4.0\r\npymol\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack load py-pymol@2.3.0\r\npymol\r\n```",
