    "body": "##### Modifications :\n- [x] added a static method to `EnvironmentModifications` that constructs instances from sourcing a file\n- [x] added unit tests\n##### Note\n\nTo modify the current environment replicating the effect of sourcing a bunch of files : \n\n``` python\nenv = EnvironmentModifications.from_sourcing_files(*files)\nenv.execute()\n```\n\nNote that this PR is an alternative to #1018 that builds an `EnvironmentModifications` instance instead of modifying directly the environment. This makes it possible to manipulate what the `source <file>` would do for other purposes than just modifying the current environment.\n",
