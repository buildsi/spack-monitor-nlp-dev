    "body": "This PR is intended to keep track of all of the external libraries that Spack vendors. More importantly, it tracks where they came from and which versions we are vendoring. This comes in handy when upgrading packages as it also lists when a package no longer supports Python 2.6 and cannot be upgraded any further.\r\n\r\nMany of these libraries are currently being upgraded in other PRs, so this PR depends on the following PRs to be merged first:\r\n\r\n- [x] argparse: #6786 \r\n- [x] distro: #6788 \r\n- [x] jinja2: #6790 \r\n- [x] py: #6789 \r\n- [x] pytest: #6801 \r\n- [x] six: #6787 ",
