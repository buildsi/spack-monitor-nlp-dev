    "body": "If specific compiler flags are set, gmp will not build a shared library, causing failures further down the line.\r\n\r\nSpecifically, we have set `cflags`, `cppflags`, `ldflags` etc. to `-mtune=native -march=native`. This causes gmp's `configure` script to misdetect shared library support, which causes the mpfr build to fail.",
