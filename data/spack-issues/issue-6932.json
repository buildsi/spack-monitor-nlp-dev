It is causing the same issue we had before.\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\npkgconf working similar to pkg-config\r\n\r\n### Actual Result\r\n\r\nErrors shown in the PRs above\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\nspack install meson\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\nCray platforms\r\n-----\r\nI've never used pkgconf so I'm not sure if it's as easy as adding the same fix. If it is then we can make a quick fix.",
