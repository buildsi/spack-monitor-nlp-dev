    "body": "These are two fixes that are necessary to build these packages on systems with an unsuitable `scons` and/or `pdflatex` installed.\r\n\r\nFor `openloops` I added `scons` as a dependency to make sure that the `openloops` call in `build_processes` finds a suitable one in its environment.\r\nFor `vbfnlo` I added a variant to toggle the building of the documentation and default it to `False`. This seems to be a long(er) standing issue in vbfnlo: vbfnlo/vbfnlo#2\r\n\r\nPinging @vvolkl and @iarspider (seem to be most active according to git blame)",
