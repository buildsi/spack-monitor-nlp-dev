    "body": "## What is it\r\n\r\n- Adds the `dependency_file` directive so that a package's dependencies can be defined in an external yaml file of the form\r\n\r\n  ```yaml\r\n  dependencies:\r\n    <spec>:\r\n      when: ...\r\n      type: ...\r\n      patches: ...\r\n  ```\r\n   \r\n- Adds the `versions_file` directive so that a package's versions can be defined in an external yaml file of the form\r\n  ```yaml\r\n  versions:\r\n    <ver>:\r\n      checksum: ...\r\n      <additional properties>\r\n  ```\r\n\r\nIn both cases, the external file must be defined relative to the package's `package.py` file.\r\n\r\n## Why?\r\n\r\nAs a package's dependency list grows with new package versions, dependency versions, variants, etc., the `package.py` file can become cluttered with `versions` and `depends_on` directives.  Putting the directives in a file cleans up `package.py` and puts the dependencies in a nice, human readable, and version controllable form.\r\n\r\n## What's next\r\n\r\nI have not added tests, documentation, examples, etc.  If this feature will be useful and the PR has a chance of being merged, I will add any additional items necessary.",
