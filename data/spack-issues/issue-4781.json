    "body": "I noticed that a few packages lately introduced the attribute `tags`, e.g. :\r\n```python\r\nclass Cloverleaf3d(MakefilePackage):\r\n    \"\"\"Proxy Application. CloverLeaf3D is 3D version of the\r\n       CloverLeaf mini-app. CloverLeaf is a mini-app that solves\r\n       the compressible Euler equations on a Cartesian grid,\r\n       using an explicit, second-order accurate method.\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n\r\n    homepage = \"http://uk-mac.github.io/CloverLeaf3D/\"\r\n    url      = \"http://mantevo.org/downloads/releaseTarballs/miniapps/CloverLeaf3D/CloverLeaf3D-1.0.tar.gz\"\r\n\r\n    tags = ['proxy-app']\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nOther packages go even further, and they have a last line in their docstring providing redundant information:\r\n```python\r\nclass Aspa(MakefilePackage):\r\n    \"\"\"A fundamental premise in ExMatEx is that scale-bridging performed in\r\n        heterogeneous MPMD materials science simulations will place important\r\n        demands upon the exascale ecosystem that need to be identified and\r\n        quantified.\r\n        tags = proxy-app\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    tags = ['proxy-app']\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nIn #4774 `tags` is only in the docstring (no attribute), and it uses a colon as a separator.\r\n\r\nI would like to start a discussion on this, because I think we should decide how to tag packages before introducing multiple inconsistent ways of doing it. Also, in case none of the above is tied to a query mechanism, I think we should also decide which use we want to make of this information (e.g. where it can be used to filter a query, and what should be the result).",
