    "body": "```packages.yaml``` has the ability to specify a package installation prefix, but in some cases a package is installed with slightly different path components than those assumed in ```<package>/package.py``` e.g. ```libdir``` might be ```<prefix>/lib64``` rather than ```<prefix>/lib``` (or _vice versa_). I would like in ```packages.yaml``` to be able to specify _e.g._ ```libdir lib64``` for a path relative to ```<prefix>```, or ```libdir  /usr/lib64``` for an absolute path possible not under ```<prefix>```. This might necessitate providing a label for the prefix path (_e.g._ ```prefix```) to give a consistent syntax. Existing packages for which this is an issue include lua* and Python*.",
