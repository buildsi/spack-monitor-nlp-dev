    "body": "Fixes #7366\r\n\r\nSpack functionality which filters spack compiler wrappers from installed files was assuming that all compilers defined `fc` and `f77`; compilers which don't define `fc` or `f77` in `compilers.yaml` were getting reference errors. This adds a guard to the access of `fc`, `f77`, `cc`, and `cxx`.",
