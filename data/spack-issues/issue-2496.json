    "body": "@mathstuf When using Spack on my OSX (10.11.6) laptop with XCode (8.1), and trying to install a package using Spack, it appears to copy the entire XCode directory into Spack and by default it appears I do not have the correct permissions for some folders:\r\n\r\n==> Warning: Copying Xcode from /Library to /Users/jrood/spack/var/spack/stage/xcode-select/clang/8.0.0-apple in order to add spack wrappers to it. Please do not interrupt.\r\n==> Error: Error: [('/Library/Application Support/Apple/ParentalControls/Users', '/Users/jrood/spack/var/spack/stage/xcode-select/clang/8.0.0-apple/Application Support/Apple/ParentalControls/Users', \"[Errno 13] Permission denied:...............................\r\n.............................\r\n.............................\r\n\r\nIs this just a configuration issue on my own laptop? I could probably change the permissions, but is it just possible to copy over just the XCode command line utils to accomplish the compiler wrapping?\r\n\r\njrood-laptop:ParentalControls jrood$ pwd\r\n/Library/Application Support/Apple/ParentalControls\r\njrood-laptop:ParentalControls jrood$ ls -alh\r\ntotal 0\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   4 root  wheel   136B Aug 27  2015 .\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  12 root  wheel   408B Dec  2  2015 ..\r\ndrwxr-xr-x   2 root  wheel    68B Aug 27  2015 ALRHelperJobs\r\ndrwx------   2 root  wheel    68B Aug 27  2015 Users",
