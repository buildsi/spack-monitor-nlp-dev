    "body": "Kitware maintains a [fork](https://github.com/Kitware/ninja) of `ninja-build`. There are outstanding PRs for mainline, but no progress has been made in months. \r\n\r\nI think it would be nice if Spack provided an easy way to access that. Few questions:\r\n- Does this sound like a good idea?\r\n- If yes, is it better to a) add a `fortran` variant to existing ninja-build, or create a new `ninja-fortran` package?\r\n- If a), how does one change a url based on variant?",
