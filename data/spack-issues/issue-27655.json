    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\n\nVisit restricts its llvm dependency to 6:8, reportedly because other versions are incompatible with GCC 6.1.0. None of these restricted versions of llvm will build on my ubuntu 20.04 system with GCC 9.3.0. If I remove the version restriction (i.e `depends_on('llvm@6:', when='^mesa')` ) and allow visit to use llvm 12.0.1 as a dependency everything builds as expected. \r\n\r\nThe 6:8 llvm version restriction should be  made conditional on gcc@:6.1.0, which is likely the only condition under which it is necessary.\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.17.0-279-76ad803f25\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.10\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-westmere\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\ngcc (Ubuntu 9.3.0-17ubuntu1~20.04) 9.3.0\r\nCopyright (C) 2019 Free Software Foundation, Inc.\r\nThis is free software; see the source for copying conditions.
