    "body": "Some compilers (intel, pgi, clang) can dynamically change their language directories depending on what GCC they are instructed to look for, which can often be changed by a compiler flag.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that we use the compiler flags for the spec when computing implicit rpaths. That allows us to account for those changes in the generated library and rpath flags.\r\n\r\nFixes a bug reported via LLNL internal chat.",
