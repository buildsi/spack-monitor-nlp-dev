    "body": "On develop, if you create a new package, it will always contain the body:\r\n```python\r\n    def install(self, spec, prefix):                                            \r\n        # FIXME: Unknown build system                                           \r\n        make()                                                                  \r\n        make('install')\r\n```\r\nregardless of whether or not the build system was correctly detected. This bug was introduced by #11981 when the variable name was changed from `body` to `body_def` but the existing package base classes were not updated. I changed the name back to `body`, but let me know if there is a good reason to keep it as `body_def`.",
