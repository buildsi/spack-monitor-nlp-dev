    "body": "If considered useful this is a cut'n paste of the `composite` decorator + tests from a small personal project that I use from time to time as a python gym. Modifications include:\r\n\r\n- [x] resources now can be looked up by name (see atlas)\r\n- [x] container customization in the `composite` decorator has been removed\r\n- [x] we can now apply reduction operations over a composite\r\n\r\nThe modification that is immediately useful is the first one, as it adresses [this comment](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/2371#discussion_r90250916). Let me know if you want me to remove reduction operations or if it is fine to leave them.",
