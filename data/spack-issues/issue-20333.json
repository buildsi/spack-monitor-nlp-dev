    "body": "This fixes a logging error, observed on macOS 11.0.1 (Big Sur). Running Spack in debugging mode, for instance `spack -dd install py-scipy`, results in log files from the compiler wrappers not getting written, instead printing errors such as \u201cNo such file or directory: None/<log file name>.\u201d This is because the log file directory gets set from `spack.main.spack_working_dir`, but that variable is not set in the spawned process. This PR passes the working directory into the subprocess through `kwargs`, and then assigns `spack.main.spack_working_dir` to it, so that the logging directory is set correctly.",
