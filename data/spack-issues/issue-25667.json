    "body": "@takluyver volunteered to maintain these packages in https://github.com/takluyver/flit/issues/439\r\n\r\nFirst question for you: my `py-flit` installation doesn't have a `flit` executable. Should it? In the build log I see warnings like:\r\n```console\r\n/Users/Adam/spack/opt/spack/darwin-catalina-x86_64/apple-clang-12.0.0/python-3.8.11-mboaywuagomyhvr2ajgug3lctyy7sahc/lib/python3.8/distutils/dist.py:274: UserWarning: Unknown distribution option: 'extras_require'\r\n  warnings.warn(msg)\r\n```\r\nbecause the `setup.py` uses `distutils` instead of `setuptools`. Should it use `setuptools` so that a `flit` executable gets installed?",
