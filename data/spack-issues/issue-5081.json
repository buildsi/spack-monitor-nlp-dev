    "body": "Third alternative to #5069 and #5070 \r\n\r\nThe action `CleanOrDirtyAction` has been added. It sets the default value for `dest` to `spack.dirty`, and changes it according to the flags passed via command line. Added unit tests to check that the arguments\r\nare parsed correctly. Removed lines in `PackageBase` that were setting the default value of dirty according to what was in the configuration.",
