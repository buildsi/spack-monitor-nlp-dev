    "body": "With this spack.yaml:\r\n```shell\r\nspack:\r\n  specs:\r\n  - tcl\r\n  container:\r\n    format: singularity\r\n  view: true\r\n```\r\nThe command:\r\n```shell\r\nspack containerize > image.def\r\n```\r\nwrites a Singularity definition that fails to build.  The problem will be fixed in [Singularity 3.8.1](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/issues/159).  The problem is that /opt/view in the first stage of 'image.def' is a symllink and Singularity doesn't handle symlinks correctly.  A short term fix is to not use a symlink:\r\n```shell\r\nrm /opt/view\r\nmkdir /opt/view\r\nmv /opt/._view/*/* /opt/view\r\n```\r\n\r\n### system\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-3534-29f10624bd\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.9\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu18.04-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original",
