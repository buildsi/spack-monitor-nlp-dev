    "body": "I simply do not seem to be able to get the hang of git. I continue to have conceptual errors using it. Last time, I had to totally blow away my own fork of spack repo and start over. This time, I have a fork of develop and I have created two branches, mfem_update, which I already had a PR accepted and committed for and, adding_h5z_zfp, which I just tried to do. However, that branch seems to also include the work I did on the mfem branch on it. So, when I tried to initiate a PR, I get the changes I wanted for h5z-zfp and I get stuff I already did from mfem_update. WTF? \r\n\r\nI would like to be able to create branches and then PRs for work on those branches, *separately*, and I don't seem to be able to make it happen.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think I need to sync. my local spack fork with the current develop. I've tried git pull, git fetch and they all say I am up to date. Do I need to take action, after forking on github, to ensure my fork is setup to update via pull or fetch from the main spack repo?",
