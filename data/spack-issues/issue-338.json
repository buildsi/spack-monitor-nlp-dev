    "body": "Modifications : \n- [x] added variant to `metis` and `parmetis` according to `BUILD.txt`\n- [x] fixed a bug in `metis` (removed false dependency on MPI)\n- [x] `parmetis` installs its `metis.h` header \n\nNotes:\nApparently there is no clean way to build `parmetis` on top of an existing `metis`. In fact, `parmetis` ships with `metis` sources at an unspecified version and `metis` symbols are included into the `parmetis` library. This may cause conflicts if both metis and parmetis are used as a dependency to another package.\n",
