    "body": "This change supports using full hash to name buildcache entries by allowing database instances to be keyed by full hash.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Expose `_cached_hash()` method on the spec class publicly (rename or add new method)\r\n- [ ] Decide whether we need to make explicit a constraint that a db and its upstream dbs must all use same hash type for their key\r\n- [x] Figure out what to do about failing test (changing db hash key appears to change DAG hash of specs inserted)\r\n- [x] Update database version information (or describe key type used in a top-level field) \r\n  * [ ] Now we have some version information stored, how do we want to use it?",
