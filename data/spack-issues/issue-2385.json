    "body": "I found that `flex` was crashing when trying to build the `binutils` dependency which exists in the dependency chain of the `py-yt` package. This was fixed by getting a newer version of `flex`.\r\n\r\nI further found that development of `flex` is currently not being done from sourceforge any more. New versions are released on github under a new release naming scheme. I've adjusted the url locations, added a new function to handle the new and old naming schemes, and added two new versions of flex.\r\n\r\n#2384 contains the commit with the necessary changes.\r\n\r\nThis PR was created by the suggestion of @davydden in #2320.",
