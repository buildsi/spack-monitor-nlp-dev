    "body": "Currently, environments only load existing paths on activation. This means that new packages in the environment do not load properly. For example\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ unset LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\n$ spack env create myenv\r\n$ spack env activate myenv\r\n$ spack install zlib\r\n$ echo $LD_LIBRARY_PATH\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in nothing in `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`. Under this PR, it now results in `$spack/var/spack/environments/myenv/.spack-env/view/lib:$spack/var/spack/environments/myenv/.spack-env/view/lib64`.",
