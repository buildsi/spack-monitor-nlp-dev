    "body": "I added variants for libraries that have external dependencies.\n- mpi to activate Boost.MPI and graph_parallel (default: False)\n- python for Boost.Python and mpi_python if mpi is activated (default: False)\n- compression for the `zlib` and `bzip2` compression in Boost.Iostream (default: True)\n\nI changed the default compilation options to build the static and shared libraries in single and multi-threaded version. With the tagged layout they are disambiguated by addition of the `-mt` suffix.\n",
