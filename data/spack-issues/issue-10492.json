    "body": "When in the `configure` phase, openmpi will search in slurm's 18-08-0-1 `/lib` directory\r\nfor a shared library named pmi or pmi2 due to the option `--with-pmi=$slurm_prefix` and finds nothing.\r\nThis commit adds **pmix** as a dependency and changes the value of the `--with-pmi` option to `$pmix_prefix`.\r\n\r\nPS: I'm aware that pmi/pmi2 are not exactly the same thing as pmix,\r\nbut they are compatible enough to give the user a working openmpi install.",
