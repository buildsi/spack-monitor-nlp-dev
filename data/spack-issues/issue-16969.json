    "body": "gcc 9.3.0 and glibc 2.31 (found in the base install of Ubuntu 20.04)\r\ncause the gcc package to error during build with the error:\r\n\r\n    \"size of array 'assertion_failed__####' is negative\"\r\n\r\nPrevious to this fix, the error was resolved for v8.1.0 <= gcc <= v9.2.0\r\nvia two patches.\r\n\r\nThis fix backports those patches for v5.3.0 <= gcc <= v7.4.0\r\n\r\nPotentially these patches need to be backported to versions of gcc\r\nbefore v5.3.0, but other compile issues need to be resolved for earlier\r\nversions of gcc first.\r\n\r\nFixes #16968",
