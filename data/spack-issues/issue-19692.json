    "body": "It would be very useful to have a hook for executing regression tests.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nIt would be very useful to have a standard hook for executing regression tests in a package.  That way package installers can have a standard command to run a regression test\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is part of the key4hep project which is using spack to create an overlay system.  It would be useful to have hooks in spack that would present a standard command to run a regression test for a package.  This command should allow for different levels of regression testing.    The goal would be to allow for a standard command that would run a regression test for a package.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIt would be similar to the %check directive of rpm\r\n\r\nAlso regression testing is particularly important/useful since we are often making different versions. Also regression testing frameworks can be used for performance testing which becomes important when dealing with different compiler flags.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\nThis seems as if it would be easy to implement.  The tricky parts is to come to some agreement about the API for the regression testing hooks.",
