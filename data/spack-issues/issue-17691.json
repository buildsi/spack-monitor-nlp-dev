On spack@0.15.1 it yields the same error.\r\nI checked:\r\n- compilers:\r\n    - gcc@7.5.0 (system)\r\n    - gcc@8.4.0 (spack-installed)\r\n- python:\r\n    - python@3.7.8\r\n    - python@3.7.4 (same as in spack 0.13.4)\r\n    - python@3.8.3\r\n- spack\r\n    - development ( on 2020-07-22)\r\n\r\nall yielding the same error. \r\n\r\nI don't see how the libdirs are passed to the linker. There are no corresponding -L statements, but that has not changed from spack@0.13.4. However, glew is provided in the SPACK_LINK_DIRS and SPACK_RPATH_DIRS (see spack-build-env.txt). The glew package has not changed since spack@0.13.4.\r\n\r\nAny help is appreciated.\r\nGerald\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
