    "body": "This PR adds a variant to every package that extends `CMakePackage` to control [`CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE`](https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/variable/CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE.html). \r\n\r\nInstead of having every package override `build_type` on their own, I figure the best way to do this is to create a universal variant for all `CMakePackage` packages.\r\n\r\nStill stumbling over a few hurdles. Apparently not all CMake packages have the same possible build types? @davydden Can you confirm that `dealii` only has the following possible values?\r\n```python\r\n# CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE should be DebugRelease | Debug | Release \r\n```\r\n`symengine` may or may not be in the same boat. Does anyone know how to check what the possible values are for any given project? I want to make sure I didn't break any of the other packages.\r\n\r\nSo I need a way of being able to override the possible values of a variant in a subclass. A simple variable didn't do the trick as the variant was registered before the value was changed. @alalazo Any ideas?\r\n\r\nAnother question: do we want the values to be lowercase or CamelCase?\r\n\r\nJust a heads up, this will change the variants (and therefore the specs/hashes) of every CMakePackage in Spack.\r\n\r\n@mathstuf may also be interested in this discussion.",
