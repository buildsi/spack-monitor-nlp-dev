    "body": "Throughout the documentation, we display examples of Spack command output. This usually includes a sample Spack command and several lines of formatted output or error messages and how to prevent them. In the .rst files, we tell Sphinx to lex this as shell script, despite the fact that there is no shell script present. Normally this is fine, and Sphinx won't do any syntax highlighting except for a couple numbers being a different color. But sometimes this generates warning messages:\n\n```\nbasic_usage.rst:1801: WARNING: Could not lex literal_block as \"sh\". Highlighting skipped.\n```\n\nThe solution is to specify a language of \"none\" for these code blocks since there is no code being displayed. They will still be formatted in code blocks, but there won't be any attempts at syntax highlighting.\n\nThis bug was discovered in #1576 by adding documentation testing. It will be fixed in #1576. This issue is being opened to track the problem.\n",
