Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\nSome packages depend on tar or findutils to build but tar or findutils is in turn broken because they were built expecting selinux support even thought the OS has disabled selinux. For example:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install flex\r\n...\r\n```\r\nwill give this error:\r\n```\r\n==> flex: Executing phase: 'autoreconf'                                                                                                                                                                            \r\n==> Error: ProcessError: Command exited with status 1:                                                                                                                                                             \r\n    './autogen.sh'                                                                                                                                                                                                 \r\n                                                                                                                                                                                                                   \r\n1 error found in build log:                                                                                                                                                                                        \r\n     14    libtoolize: putting macros in AC_CONFIG_MACRO_DIRS, 'm4'.                                                                                                                                               \r\n     15    libtoolize: linking file 'm4/libtool.m4'                                                                                                                                                                \r\n     16    libtoolize: linking file 'm4/ltoptions.m4'                                                                                                                                                              \r\n     17    libtoolize: linking file 'm4/ltsugar.m4'                                                                                                                                                                \r\n     18    libtoolize: linking file 'm4/ltversion.m4'                                                                                                                                                              \r\n     19    libtoolize: linking file 'm4/lt~obsolete.m4'                                                                                                                                                            \r\n  >> 20    find: error while loading shared libraries: libselinux.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory                                                                                  \r\n     21    autopoint: *** infrastructure files for version 0.18 not found; this is autopoint from GNU gettext-tools 0.21                                                                                           \r\n     22    autopoint: *** Stop.                                                                                                                                                                                    \r\n     23    autoreconf: autopoint failed with exit status: 1                              \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-1022-80fe51046\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-haswell\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
