Use the following `packages.yaml`:\n\n```\npackages:\n    python:\n        version: [3.5]\n```\n1. `spack spec python` yields:\n\n```\n  python@2.7.12%gcc@4.8.5~tk~ucs4 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\n```\n\nThis is wrong.  `preferred=True` should have the same precedence as one version simply having the highest number.  It is possible to get v3.5 with `spack spec python@3:`\n\n```\npython@3.5.2%gcc@4.8.5~tk~ucs4 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\n```\n\nFor now, I'm removing `preferred=True` from `python/package.py`.\n",
