    "body": "I have encountered many HPC systems where the `/tmp` directory is not large enough to hold a complete build tree. I then have to manually create symbolic links to work around this. On many HPC systems there are multiple front ends, and when I log in the next time, I might end up on a different login node, and I then have to create another symbolic link.\n\nI think Spack should, by default, use `var/spack` directly as staging directory, and not use `/tmp`.\n\nAlso, there should be a configuration mechanism to choose this on a per-system basis, similar to the default value for `make -jN`. Spack should also have the \"right\" settings built in for \"the usual systems\", i.e. the commonly used HPC systems available to open research.\n",
