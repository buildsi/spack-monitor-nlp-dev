    "body": "Hi\r\n\r\nI am trying to add a new package which has a broken MakeFile.  ```LDFLAGS``` in the file must be modified before it can be compiled.  The developers have [yet to merge the fix](https://github.com/vcflib/vcflib/pull/205) yet into their project so I want to do it here in Spack.\r\n\r\nI have tried this which does not work:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef setup_environment(self, spack_env, run_env):\r\n    spack_env.append_flags('LDFLAGS', '-llzma')\r\n    spack_env.append_flags('LDFLAGS', '-lbz2')\r\n```\r\n\r\nFrom [Packaging Guide](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/04a4ac68d5320f02f30c4d24ff62a8322ea84dc0/lib/spack/docs/packaging_guide.rst) this does not work either:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef ldflags_flag_handler(self, env, flag_val):\r\n    env.append_flags('-llzma')\r\n    env.append_flags('-lbz2')\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nThanks for the guidance!
