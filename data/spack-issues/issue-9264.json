    "body": "It seems that Qt's webkit option would not build with earlier gcc versions, so the Qt configure script had some specific exclusions. However, it was not up to date with recent gcc releases. This patch adds gcc 5, 6, 7 and 8 to those assumed to build webkit. I confess I have only tested this on gcc-7, on Linux SLES-12. \r\n\r\nThere is also a specific case for hpux/gcc, and I have added the same extra version numbers there, too, totally untested. ",
