    "body": "I want to achieve something like `spack load *%gcc@7.3.0`. \r\n\r\nI understand, that this particular syntax wouldn't work since asterisks are interpreted by the shell. \r\n\r\nI tried to do something like `spack find | grep 'gcc@7.3.0' | xargs spack load {}`, but I couldn't make `spack find` output a simple plain list. \r\n\r\nIn theory I could do the same with the `modules` shell command that `spack bootstrap` have installed during the bootstrap, but the piping of the `modules` is surprisingly complex. I went so far to get \r\n\r\n``` \r\n(module -t avail)2>&1 | grep 'gcc-7.3.0-' | xargs module load {}\r\n```\r\nbut the `xargs` doesn't see the `module` command. Do you have any ideas?\r\n",
