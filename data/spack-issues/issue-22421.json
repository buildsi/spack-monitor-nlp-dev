    "body": "This change will make pushes to develop behave the same as the corresponding PR for CI:\r\n-  If we merge to develop only changes to packages we'll run a reduced set of unit tests with no coverage\r\n-  If we change anything outside the built-in repository we'll run the full unit-test suite with coverage\r\n\r\nGiven the ratio of package only PRs / core changes this should have a great impact on the cpu-time required for CI.",
