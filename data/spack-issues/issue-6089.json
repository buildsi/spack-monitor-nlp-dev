    "body": "While using spack to build packages and create module files (dotkit, tcl, and lmod), we found that it appears spack does not know what `spack_cc` is when creating the module files.  I appears to be related to packages that have `\"CC=%s\" % spack_cc` (or similar) in `def configure_args(self)`.\r\n\r\nWhen spack attempts to create the module files for these packages, we get the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n> spack module refresh -y -m lmod gdbm\r\n==> Regenerating lmod module files\r\n==> Warning: Could not write module file [/home/fms/opt/modules/linux-rhel7-x86_64/Core/gdbm/1.13.lua]\r\n==> Warning:    --> global name 'spack_cc' is not defined <--\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt appears, that although  `\"CC=%s\" % spack_cc` is expanded correctly during the configure step, that process is not occurring during the module file creation.  Or, is there something we need to do to get past this?",
