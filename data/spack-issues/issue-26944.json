    "body": "Discovered whilst trying to install the dependent `vc` package. \r\n\r\nVirtest uses the `-R` flag to CTest to run tests as part of the build, but this can cause a bad match - specifically, an error is encountered with the `empty` test, which tries to run the `empty-14` test instead of the correct `empty` executable. The build then fails as the `empty-14` target hasn't (may not have) been built yet.\r\n\r\nThe PR adds an inplace patch to make the CTest command match the required test/executable name exactly.",
