    "body": "I'd like to suggest having improved development docs, meaning commands and definitions that become available in the package.py when we do `from spack import *`. Currently, the developer docs [linked here](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide.html) provide a few functions, but don't walk you nicely through the steps of how to create a package. It's most likely to get experience based on trial and error, but I think it would be better to avoid the error all together.\r\n\r\n### The kinds of packages\r\nI had to poke around the repository to find the different package types available to me. This should probably be the entrypoint / first question - what kind of package do you want to create today? Here are the bases...\r\n\r\n### Resources\r\nThese ones are fairly intuitive, but I still messed them up. I want someone to tell me explicitly the differences in url and git, and then what different ways there are to use version (my first attempt I did it wrong). What other variables could I define that aren't in most examples? is it possible that most examples look the same because everyone tends to copy others as templates? (Note, I was doing a ton of grep-ping to find similar installs to give me hints!)\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    homepage = \"https://www.sylabs.io/singularity/\"\r\n     url      = \"https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/releases/download/v3.1.1/singularity-3.1.1.tar.gz\"\r\n     git      = \"https://github.com/singularityware/singularity.git\"\r\n\r\n     version('develop', branch='master')\r\n     version('3.1.1', '158f58a79db5337e1d655ee0159b641e42ea7435')\r\n\r\n     depends_on('go')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Args\r\nThen let's look at the args to all the functions that show up in these other files - each takes args `self, spec, prefix` and I have no idea what those are (and learned later there are classes!)  I want to know what they are.\r\n\r\n### Functions\r\nWhat are all these beautiful functions I'm allowed to use but I don't have a clue about because we get them with \"from spack import *\" ? To have concrete examples for writing a custom function, do_stage, edit, build_targets, editing environment variables, install_targets, etc - this is what would make it easy to jump into developing for spack. I'd like to know all the details without being an experienced spack developer.\r\n\r\n### Pro Tips \r\nAnd then for example, functions that are cool and helpful! In the small amount of work I've taken I've discovered functions that are helpful that weren't obvious to me other than looking at other examples, and I suspect this is the tip of the iceberg. :) A few examples:\r\n\r\n - working_dir\r\n - tty\r\n - make\r\n - Executable\r\n \r\nWe could probably rename this PR to \"tell me all the things!\" I really think it would be helpful to have, possibly even in a more tutorial sort of format or outside of the readthedocs so it's fun / comfortable to parse.",
