    "body": "Update to new release 1.22.4 implies dependency on texinfo at build time, and preconv ability to detect file encoding is improved when linking it with uchardet. iconv dependency was needed in configure already in 1.22.3 so that dependency was added.\r\nGraphical options with X was added as a variant (false as a default).\r\nRelease 1.22.4 accepts parallel build, unlike 1.22.3.\r\nPatch gropdf.patch is also removed since it was never used.",
