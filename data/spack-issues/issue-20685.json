    "body": "All of these Xorg `*proto` packages are header-only packages. Back when I wrote #1740, I made the mistake of thinking that these could be uninstalled after installation, and therefore they should be `type='build'`. In reality, in order for Spack's compiler wrappers to work, these need to be `type='link'`. This has been fixed for some packages already, but this PR fixes the remaining packages.",
