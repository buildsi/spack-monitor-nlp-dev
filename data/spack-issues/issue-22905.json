    "body": "Adding the possibility to compile a VisIt plugin using spack independently\r\nfrom the VisIt installation, itself with or without spack.\r\nThere is also a \"local\" version which is useful for local development.\r\nOther sources and versions are exactly the ones of VisIt.\r\nNote that it can be used to update a plugin in an older release of VisIt (when possible).\r\nHere it is the \"CGNS\" plugin that for the moment works with cgns@3.3.1\r\n",
