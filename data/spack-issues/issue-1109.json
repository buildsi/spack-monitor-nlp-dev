    "body": "I think you can already add custom paths eg. export `PYTHONHOME` to a generated environment module using [this](http://software.llnl.gov/spack/basic_usage.html#override-package-api) method in `package.py` but it would be nice to be able to not have to modify the `package.py` file or override it with another local package.\n\nI am thinking something like this for the `modules.yaml` config:\n\n``` yaml\nmodules:\n  ...\n  jdk:\n    set_env:\n      - JAVA_HOME: $prefix\n  foo:\n    prepend_path:\n      - BAR: $prefix.lib\n    append_path:\n      - BAZ: $prefix.include\n```\n\nWhere you can reference any of the prefix attribute variables listed [here](http://software.llnl.gov/spack/packaging_guide.html#id12).\n",
