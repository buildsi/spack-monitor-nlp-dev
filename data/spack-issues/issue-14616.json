    "body": "Fixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/13604\r\n\r\nThis closes stdin for all Git fetches; this allows Spack to automatically fail in the case that a git URL was misconfigured such that Spack attempts to pull from somewhere that requires user credentials. Without this, commands like `spack mirror --all` would stall for such misconfigured packages.\r\n\r\nAt the moment this assumes that all Spack packages intend to pull from Git repositories without credentials.\r\n\r\nTODOs\r\n\r\n- [ ] add testing\r\n- [ ] add an option for users who create a private Spack package that does in fact need to prompt the user for credentials during a Git pull\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/13925: that PR adds timeouts to fetchers, which is not a good approach for misconfigured git repositories but may be useful for stalling URL fetches. That being said it may be better to configure more sensitive timeouts via curl as https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/13881 does.",
