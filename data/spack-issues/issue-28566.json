    "body": "Extracted from #27138 to make that PR smaller and so that people who are having trouble building this package (me) can build it immediately.\r\n\r\n@tgamblin this is another case of a package where separate concretization of build deps is required just to build. Modern TF requires newer Bazel than WIT supports. Same problem affects `py-jupyter-packaging`.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully installs on macOS 10.15.7 with Python 3.9.9 and Apple Clang 12.0.0.",
