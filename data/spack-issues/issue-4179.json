    "body": "I don't actually need this package anymore, but I figured I might as well add it since it works.\r\n\r\nFor a while now I've been using an external installation for Perl. Mostly because I can't install Perl with Intel, not because it takes a while to build. But when I tried building Git, it failed because it was missing ExtUtils::MakeMaker. I did some more debugging and found that I couldn't install any of the other Perl packages with my system Perl either. It turns out that I had `perl` installed but not `perl-devel`, which provides things like ExtUtils. Long story short, just let Spack build everything, external packages aren't reliable.",
