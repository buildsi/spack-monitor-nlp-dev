    "body": "Attempted fix for #18444 \r\n\r\nGCC actually needs the CUDA driver lib (libcuda.so) instead of the runtime lib (libcudart.so).\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to properly fix https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/17619 / https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/18000.\r\n\r\nCurrently I cannot really test it, since GCC +nvptx fails because of other reasons now :) they use sm_30 somewhere in their defaults, which my CUDA driver does not support.\r\n\r\n--\r\n\r\nI guess the `libs` property is special in spack, whereas my `driver_libs` property is custom. Can someone comment on whether this is a good idea or not? At any rate, there's two things: (a) we don't want the stub lib to end up in the rpaths, so we shouldn't add driver libs to `libs`, and (b) some packages actually need the driver lib.",
