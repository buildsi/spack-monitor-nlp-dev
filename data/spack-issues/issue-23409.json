    "body": "* Added checksum for recently released 4.8.0\r\n* Added `enable-fsync` variant.  The `fsync` flag was added to the configuration as of version 4.1.0 and later.  Originally, it defaulted to `on`, but at version 4.3.0 and later, it was changed to default to `off` and a `enable-fsync` configuration flag was added to enable it.  \r\n\r\nThe spack package has the `--enable-fsync` specified with no way to disable for all builds of netcdf-c 4.1.0 and later.  This can cause horrendously slow I/O for certain use cases (e.g. 7 seconds with no-fsync versus 2300 seconds with fsync enabled).  With the new variant, the default build behavior matches the default of non-spack netCDF.",
