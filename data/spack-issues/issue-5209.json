    "body": "Spack can parallelize builds of any package by the package's makefile. Some packages don't support parallel make (e.g. their make's fail with `make -j K` if `K` is greater than one).\r\n\r\nSometimes, I may be sitting on a resource reservation with multiple nodes; maybe 3 nodes each with 16 cores. Can spack parallelize its dependency graph across (or even within) nodes?\r\n\r\nI mean, can it launch parallel builds of multiple independent dependents and, can it do so across nodes? Even within a single node, it would be useful because in many cases `make -j K` underutilizes available CPU resources because the source directory contains less than `K` targets.\r\n\r\nThis is really more of a curiosity if anyone is looking at this kind of parallelism in Spack? I can see it being *very* useful in situations involving large and complex build matricies though.",
