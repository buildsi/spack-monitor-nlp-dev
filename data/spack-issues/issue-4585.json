    "body": "This implements some of the functionality for a ```spack env``` command described at https://github.com/LLNL/spack/wiki/Environments-Road-Map (EDIT: `spack context` as discussed in the proposal has since been renamed to `spack env`).\r\n\r\nAn environment is used to group together a subset of package installs. This description can be used to replicate the installation on other systems. It can also be used to collect the environment modifications necessary to expose that subset of packages to a user.\r\n\r\nExample commands:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack env create c2\r\nspack env add c2 openmpi\r\nspack env concretize c2\r\nspack env list c2\r\nspack env relocate c2 --compiler=gcc@4.6.1 # reconcretize, replace previous compiler with gcc@4.6.1\r\nspack env list c2 --include-deps\r\nspack env upgrade c2 libxml2 # upgrade the libxml2 dependency\r\nspack env list-modules c2 # show all modules for all packages in the context\r\n```",
