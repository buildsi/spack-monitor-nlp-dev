    "body": "This adds a timeout to fetching of resources in Spack. This assumes that any resource can be retrieved in a fixed amount of time (currently 10 minutes). The timeout is currently added only for git/URL resources (but could easily be added for any).\r\n\r\nThis is intended to address #13604, and to work as a catch-all for all issues which for one reason or another permanently stall fetching a resource. This could include:\r\n\r\n* A download which never terminates\r\n* A git clone which requires interaction (which will never occur when mirroring all packages)\r\n\r\nOverall, this will only work well if timeouts are rare (since a large timeout is required to accommodate large downloads).",
