    "body": "Hi guys,\r\n\r\nI just tried installing ParaView with osmesa-support with a simple `spack install paraview+osmesa` on a cluster where I have no sudo-access. git and a gcc-compiler are in PATH and all of the dependencies build smoothly. During the CMake-phase of the ParaView-module however, I get an error which essentially comes down to the fact that the osmesa-library is missing. I attached the (renamed) spack-build.out of the ParaView-stage. Is it intended behaviour that I would have to build that library myself and then (somehow) link against it or provide a path? I would love to avoid having to build it myself. Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nRegards,\r\n\r\nMathias\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAttachment - ParaView stage output:\r\n[spack-build.out.txt](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/969788/spack-build.out.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n   ",
