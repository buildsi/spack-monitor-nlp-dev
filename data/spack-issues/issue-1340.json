    "body": "Resolves #1337. Deptypes are still new and easy to forget when writing Python/R packages which require them. This PR adds example dependencies so that it is easier to follow the syntax. @glennpj @mathstuf @becker33 \n\nI also noticed that my #1171 accidentally overwrote my changes in #1260, so I added back the cmake and scons build dependency types. @davydden @becker33 \n",
