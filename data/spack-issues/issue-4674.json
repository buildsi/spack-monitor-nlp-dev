    "body": "While deploying softwares ideally one we have version with specific `commit/tag` and then install it via `spack`. \r\n\r\nWe have some packages that are being installed from `branch`. This is useful in scenario where developer fix the issue and other users do `spack install` and they get what they want. \r\n\r\nBut I wonder if Spack stores associated commit id somewhere. I am looking at installed `spec.yaml` but there is only `version: branch`. Is there a way to store/retrieve that information? Won't that be useful?",
