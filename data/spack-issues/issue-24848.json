    "body": "The Makefile for the MAGMA smoke tests uses pkg-config to find the MAGMA compile flags, but the `test()` routine in the spack package was not configured to provide the location of the pkg-config file.  This modification sets PKG_CONFIG_PATH correctly to allow the smoketests to successfully compile. It also removes the *_dir variables which were unused by the magma examples/Makefile.\r\n\r\n@sshudler ",
