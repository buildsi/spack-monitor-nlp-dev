    "body": "As suggested in #704, this should hopefully prevent the use of a system GTK+ when `~gtk` is chosen (the default). I haven't tested it myself, and I'm not familiar with qt, so someone else should test it.\n\nI assume the configure function for version 3 was missing `common_config_args`? If not I can remove it.\n",
