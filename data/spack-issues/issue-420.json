    "body": "The qhull patch wasn't working when I tried to install it. There is a newer version available anyway, which didn't need to be patched for me. While I was at it, I shortened the description since it was really long. Let me know if you want me to change it back.\n\nI'm not sure why 2012.1 is listed as version 1.0. There is a qhull-1.0.tar.gz on the website, so maybe it should point to that? In the Changes.txt, 2012.1 is something like version 6.3.1.\n\nMaybe whoever created the package or wrote the patch could comment on why it isn't working or why 2012.1 is listed as version 1.0.\n",
