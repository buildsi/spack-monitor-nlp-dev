    "body": "The reason I started this PR was because I couldn't get CMake to build when using the Intel compilers. I then noticed that CMake was missing a ton of dependencies, which were in turn missing other dependencies. After all of that trouble... I still can't get CMake to build with Intel! I'll file a separate issue for CMake, but regardless I think this PR should be merged.\n",
