    "body": "Fixes an issue reported by @twang15 in #8491.\r\n\r\n### Before\r\n\r\nIf you try to build Spack's documentation with Sphinx 1.7.1+, you encounter the following error message:\r\n```\r\n$ make\r\nsphinx-build -b html -d _build/doctrees  -E . _build/html\r\nRunning Sphinx v1.7.5\r\nusage: sphinx-build [OPTIONS] -o <OUTPUT_PATH> <MODULE_PATH> [EXCLUDE_PATTERN, ...]\r\nsphinx-build: error: argument -d/--maxdepth: invalid int value: '_build/doctrees'\r\n\r\nConfiguration error:\r\nThe configuration file (or one of the modules it imports) called sys.exit()\r\nmake: *** [html] Error 2\r\n```\r\nThis bug was introduced in https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/pull/4624, which first appears in Sphinx 1.7.1. See https://github.com/sphinx-doc/sphinx/issues/5104 for the nitty-gritty details.\r\n\r\nThe reason no one has noticed it until now is that we lock down our version of Sphinx to 1.7.0 for the documentation tests.\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix would be to replace `sphinx.apidoc.main` with `sphinx.ext.apidoc.main`. This solution was not chosen because `sphinx.ext.apidoc` did not exist before 1.7.0. This solution _should_ work for all versions of Sphinx, although testing with older versions would be greatly appreciated.",
