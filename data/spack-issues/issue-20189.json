    "body": "Have hit this issue on a few systems now where location of gcc cannot be trusted to give a consistent location for the install prefix.  By querying the gcc execuable itself it seems it provides a better approach.\r\n\r\nErrors I would get during llvm build would be:\r\n```\r\n     80847        /apps/spack/opt/linux-rhel7-skylake_avx512/gcc-8.1.0/llvm-11.\r\n              0.0-s4pz3g4h3dladmlwlrldac5eflo44izh/bin/clang      -rdynamic CMa\r\n              keFiles/cmTC_b709c.dir/testCCompiler.c.o  -o cmTC_b709c\r\n  >> 80848    ld: cannot find crtbegin.o: No such file or directory\r\n  >> 80849        ld: cannot find -lgcc\r\n  >> 80850        ld: cannot find -lgcc_s\r\n  >> 80851        clang-11: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use\r\n              -v to see invocation)\r\n  >> 80852        gmake[1]: *** [cmTC_b709c] Error 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nBy applying this patch it helps.",
