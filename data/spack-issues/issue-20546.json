    "body": "There appears to be a [long-standing bug](https://github.com/FFTW/fftw3/issues/78) that prevents compilation of `fftw` with PGI if either the `avx2` or `avx512` SIMD features are enabled.\r\n\r\nI confirmed this using PGI 19.7 on an Intel Skylake node. See the attached [Spack build output](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5740447/spack-build-out_fftw-BROKEN.txt) for details.\r\n\r\nThis patch simply disables both of these features when `pgi` is in use.",
