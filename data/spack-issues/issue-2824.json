    "body": "I've tested it pretty thoroughly, but I'm not sure if the dependencies are fully formed.  The python version / ipdb version matching should be correct, but I am unsure if `py-ipython` dependency is valid.  That is, I'm not entirely sure that if a user tries to install `py-ipdb` with `python@2.4.x`, the correct `py-ipython` would be installed.\r\n\r\nOther than that this should be good!  If, however, `py-jupyter` is ever packaged, this module should be updated to select *either* `py-ipdb` or `py-jupyter` as a dependency.  Is this possible?",
