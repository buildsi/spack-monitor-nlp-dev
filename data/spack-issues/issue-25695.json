    "body": "fixes #20340\r\n\r\nSpec matrices are expanded as cross-products in a best-effort fashion i.e. if some dimension would prevent a spec in the cross-product space to concretize, that dimension is discarded.\r\n\r\nThe current algorithm relies on the iterative nature of the original concretizer and searches which constraints in the cross-product to discard based on the exceptions raised during the build of a concrete spec. This approach cannot work with the new ASP-based solver, which solves the constraint problem \"at once\". \r\n\r\nThus, the algorithm has been modified in a way that fits both the original and ASP-based solver: if a spec cannot be concretized the last dimension from the cartesian product is popped, until we reach a concretizeable spec or raise.\r\n\r\nModfications:\r\n- [x] Simplify the algorithm for best effort expansion of matrices\r\n- [ ] Don't print core dumps in intermediate stages when using clingo\r\n- [ ] Add unit tests",
