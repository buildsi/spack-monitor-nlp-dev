(They would likely be symlinks to the \"original\" modules generated in Spack).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThere is a persistent desire for this feature.  But people are doing it in a way that breaks Spack.\r\n\r\n> What I do in the center Spack installation is to use module suffixes, as described in customize-the-naming-scheme.\r\n>\r\n>In your case, I think that you want to have modules.yaml file something similar to\r\n\r\n```\r\nmodules:\r\n  enable::\r\n    - tcl\r\n  tcl:\r\n    verbose: True\r\n    hash_length: 0\r\n    naming_scheme: \"${ARCHITECTURE}/${COMPILERNAME}-${COMPILERVER}/${PACKAGE}/${VERSION}\"\r\n    all:\r\n      suffixes:\r\n        '+cuda': 'cuda'\r\n        '~cuda': 'nocuda'\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
