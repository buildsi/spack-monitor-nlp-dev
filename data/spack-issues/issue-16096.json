    "body": "This PR adds the sumo package, as well as the fox package as a\r\ndependency. It also updates and adds some fixes for openscenegraph.\r\n\r\nFor fox, the patch is for the development version. That patch should not\r\nbe necessary in future versions as it has been applied upstream. The\r\nstable version is 1.6.57 and is marked as preferred. This is the version\r\nneeded for sumo.\r\n\r\nAdded dependencies for openscenegraph as well as set constraints on qt\r\nversions.",
