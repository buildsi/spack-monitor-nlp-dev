    "body": "This change fixes (at least) two problems:\r\n\r\n1. proj uses its stage directory during configure_args. However, configure_options does not set up the stage, leading to OSErrors about the stage directory (see #10649). This change will lead to missing configure_args in such cases but allows regenerating the module file and avoids needlessy setting up fake stages during refresh.\r\n2. libxml2 uses global variables exported by python. Again, configure_options does not set up the environment appropriately, leading to NameErrors (see #10716). In addition to ignoring NameErrors, this change will set up the package environment so global variables can be found during refresh.\r\n\r\nFixes #10649, #10716\r\ncloses #14361 ",
