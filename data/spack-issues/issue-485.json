    "body": "Modifications : \n- [x] `netlib-blas` has been removed\n- [x] `netlib-lapack` provides both `blas` and `lapack`\n- [x] added `lapacke` variant\n\nProblem I see with the current layout : \n- we split the build of a single tarball into two different packages\n- we use two different build mechanism (`make` for `netlib-blas` and `cmake` for `netlib-lapack`)\n- we don't build a shared version of `netlib-blas` just a relocatable one, and that is a pain\n",
