    "body": "### Problem\r\nThe `SpecLexer` works fine, but is a little hard to extend, which we may wish to do when expanding the spec syntax as in #24025 and #29098.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Rewrite the `Lexer` interface to allow navigation between multiple lexer modes by name.\r\n- Also avoid the need to manually write out `lambda scanner, val: ...` in subclasses of `Lexer` for a more declarative interface.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\nThe spec lexing code should be a little easier to follow.",
