    "body": "<!-- Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\nExample: \"I ran `spack find` to list all the installed packages and ...\" -->\r\n\r\nRunning the clingo based concretizer within an environment to install `fftw`, `netlib-lapack`, and `netlib-scalapack` results in multiple installs of `cmake`.  I expected to have one install of each package.  Am I doing something wrong in my `spack.yaml` setup?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nCreate an environment:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nspack env create test0160_0\r\nspack env activate\r\ncd $SPACK_ROOT/var/spack/environments/test0160_0\r\n```\r\n\r\nReplace `spack.yaml` with the following contents.  Note, replace the `gcc` compiler path and version as appropriate.\r\n\r\n```console\r\nspack:\r\n  config:\r\n    concretizer: clingo\r\n    concretization: together\r\n  specs:\r\n  - cmake\r\n  - openmpi\r\n  - fftw\r\n  - netlib-lapack\r\n  - netlib-scalapack\r\n  packages:\r\n    all:\r\n      compiler: [gcc@10.2.0]\r\n      providers:\r\n        mpi: [openmpi]\r\n      version: []\r\n      target: []\r\n      buildable: true\r\n    openmpi:\r\n      version: [4.0.5]\r\n      target: []\r\n      compiler: []\r\n      buildable: true\r\n      providers: {}\r\n    cmake:\r\n      version: [3.18.4]\r\n      variants: ~doc ~ncurses\r\n      target: []\r\n      compiler: []\r\n      buildable: true\r\n      providers: {}\r\n  compilers:\r\n  - compiler:\r\n      spec: gcc@10.2.0\r\n      paths:\r\n        cc: /usr/bin/gcc\r\n        cxx: /usr/bin/g++\r\n        f77: /usr/bin/gfortran\r\n        fc: /usr/bin/gfortran\r\n      flags: {}\r\n      operating_system: archrolling\r\n      target: zen2\r\n      modules: []\r\n      environment: {unset: []}\r\n      extra_rpaths: []\r\n```\r\n\r\nRun the concretizer:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nspack concretize -f &> concretized.log\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output. If there was no error message and no output but the result is incorrect, describe how it does not match what you expect. -->\r\n\r\nThe expected output from conretization is one `cmake` install.  `grep`ing the concretizer output for `cmake` shows that there are two different installs.  The full output from concretization is attached. [concretized.log](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5765786/concretized.log).  \r\n\r\n```console\r\n~/software/spack/var/spack/environments/test0160_0 ((releases/latest))$ grep cmake concretized.log \r\n==> Concretized cmake\r\n -   iisxpyo  cmake@3.18.4%gcc@10.2.0~doc~ncurses+openssl+ownlibs~qt patches=bf695e3febb222da2ed94b3beea600650e4318975da90e4a71d6f31a6d5d8c3d arch=linux-archrolling-zen2\r\n -   pqzkqp3      ^cmake@3.18.4%gcc@10.2.0~doc~ncurses~openssl+ownlibs~qt patches=bf695e3febb222da2ed94b3beea600650e4318975da90e4a71d6f31a6d5d8c3d arch=linux-archrolling-zen2\r\n -   iisxpyo      ^cmake@3.18.4%gcc@10.2.0~doc~ncurses+openssl+ownlibs~qt patches=bf695e3febb222da2ed94b3beea600650e4318975da90e4a71d6f31a6d5d8c3d arch=linux-archrolling-zen2\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote, when this was tested on a cluster running slurm adding the `+pmi schedulers=slurm` variants to the `openmpi` spec results in two `openmpi` installs instead of one.  Is there a problem with how I'm requesting variants?\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n```console\r\n~/software/spack/var/spack/environments/test0160_0 ((releases/latest))$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0\r\n* **Python:** 3.9.0\r\n* **Platform:** linux-archrolling-zen2\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output (not applicable?)\r\n\r\n",
