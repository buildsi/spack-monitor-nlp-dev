    "body": "Fixes #2249.  Fixes #1815.\r\n\r\nThe changes in this pull request will fix the issues described in issue #2249 and generally improve architecture handling in Spack.  These changes include the following updates:\r\n\r\n- [x] Implement the `spack.spec.ArchSpec` type to represent abstract architecture requirements (e.g. like `spack.spec.CompilerSpec` does for compilers).\r\n- [x] Replace the architecture information being used in the `spack.spec.Spec` type with `spack.spec.ArchSpec` to facilitate better ambiguous architecture handling.\r\n- [x] Add unit tests to verify that the functionality specific to `spack.spec.ArchSpec` works properly.",
