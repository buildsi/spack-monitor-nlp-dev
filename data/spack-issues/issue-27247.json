    "body": "There is a bug in Python versions < 3.7.4 that causes PermissionError to occur when using shutil.copy2 to copy read-only files that have extended attributes set by Lustre (which is used by lib/spack/llnl/util/filesystem.py:504 to copy directory trees). The upstream Python bug is [here](https://bugs.python.org/issue24538).\r\n\r\nSetting SPACK_PYTHON to point to a python executable >= version 3.7.4 fixes the problem. However, for Python versions below this, we monkeypatch shutil.copystat to set extended attributes *before* setting permissions. This means that copying read-only files that have extended attributes set by Lustre can succeed, which is necessary to install openjdk (and fix #25354). I have confirmed on my cluster that this patch fixes openjdk installation when spack is installed on a Lustre FS when using Python 3.6.",
