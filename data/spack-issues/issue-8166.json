    "body": "pdftk is a nifty command-line utility to pull apart and rearrange PDFs.  And one I rely on, so that's why I'm putting it into Spack.\r\n\r\nThis is a unique package (from Spack's point of view) because it is written in a combination of Java and C++, and REQUIRES GCJ to build.  This package works, but I'm not sure how to best do a lot of the unique things it needs to do.  I'm looking for feedback.\r\n\r\nNotes:\r\n\r\n1. It requires a compiler other than C/C++/Fortran/Fortran77.  So I'm not sure how this would best fit into Spack's compiler infrastructure.\r\n\r\n2. It ONLY builds with GCC.  There's no compatiblity with Intel or anything else, because GCC is the only compiler that provides GCJ.\r\n\r\n3. GCJ has been removed from GCC as of version 7, so this requires an \"older\" version of GCC.\r\n\r\n4. There are some problems getting GCJ working properly (see #8165).  Those issues could be addressed in the `gcc` package, or in an auxiliary package that would be needed for anything requiring `gcj` --- this package is likely the only thing that will ever need that.\r\n",
