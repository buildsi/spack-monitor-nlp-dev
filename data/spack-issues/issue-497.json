    "body": "This does several things:\n- Add `sbang`: a script to run scripts with long shebang lines.\n  - Documentation for `sbang` is in `bin/sbang`.\n- Add an `sbang` hook that filters the `bin` directory after install\n  and modifies any scripts wtih shebangs that are too long to use\n  `sbang` instead.\n- `sbang` is at the top level, so it should be runnable (not much we\n  can do if spack itself is too deep for shebang)\n  - `sbang`, when used as the interpreter, runs the _second_ shebang\n    line it finds in a script.\n  - shoud fix issues with too long shebang paths.\n",
