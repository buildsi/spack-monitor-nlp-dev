(many many more errors)\r\n/bin/tar: Cython-0.25.2/USAGE.txt: Cannot change ownership to uid 96258, gid 5000: Invalid argument\r\n/bin/tar: Cython-0.25.2: Cannot change ownership to uid 96258, gid 5000: Invalid argument\r\n/bin/tar: Exiting with failure status due to previous errors\r\n```\r\nThe tar errors cause spack to stop.  I am not sure if there is anyway to defensively avoid this, but if its possible it would be a good enhancement to spack. \r\n",
