    "body": "This PR actually provides two new Spack packages: `cromwell` and `cromwell-womtool` related to the Workflow ~Development~ Description Language (WDL).\r\n\r\nhttps://cromwell.readthedocs.io/en/stable/\r\n\r\n* `cromwell` is the workflow engine server and client.  It is distributed as a single jar file (`cromwell-{version}.jar`)\r\n* `cromwell-womtool` is a set of utilities to aid in the creation of WDL workflows.  It is distributed as a single jar file (`womtool-{version}.jar`)\r\n\r\nI went back and forth over how to name these packages, but I think the current formulation makes the most sense.  The two jar files are distributed as a single release.  They have recently been in lockstep, but I think it's simpler if we treat them as two separate packages.\r\n\r\nFor both jar files, I provide convenience shell wrappers, named `cromwell` and `womtool`.  The approach was copied from the [picard](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/picard/package.py) package.\r\n\r\n(edit: fix WDL acronym)",
