    "body": "A common question from users has been how to model variants that are new in new versions of a package, or variants that are dependent on other variants. Our stock answer so far has been an unsatisfying combination of \"just have it do nothing in the old versoin\" and \"tell Spack it conflicts\".\r\n\r\nThis PR enables conditional variants, on any spec condition. The syntax is straightforward, and matches that of previous features.\r\n\r\n```\r\nvariant('version_based', default=False, when='@2.0:', description=\"Variant that is only available in versions 2.0 and later\")\r\nvariant('variant_based', default=False, when='+version_based', description=\"Variant that depends on another variant\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nPR includes tests.\r\n\r\nCloses #9740\r\nThis is a prereq to addressing #14337",
