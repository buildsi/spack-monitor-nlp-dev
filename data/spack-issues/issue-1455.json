    "body": "The changes in this pull request add the `+webkit` variant to the `qt` package, which is a boolean variant that determines whether or not `qt` builds with the optional [webkit module](http://doc.qt.io/qt-4.8/demos.html#webkit).  The majority of these changes were made in order to satisfy the new style guidelines; the only crucial changes are the added package dependencies (specifically, `flex`, `bison`, `icu4c`, `gperf`, and `fontconfig`).  I was able to build and link against installed variants `qt@4.8.6+webkit` and `qt@5.5.1+webkit` on RedHat6 when compiling with GCC 4.7.2, and I also verified that `qt@4.8.6~webkit` still builds properly.\n\nSince I performed my tests on a machine that was previously configured to install `qt`, I suspect that I've missed a number of dependencies with these changes.  I tried using `ldd` on all of the output libraries/binaries to see what I missed and I've attached [a text list containing the relevant results](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/402729/qt-deps.txt).  If any of these dependencies seem like they shouldn't be handled by system libraries, please let me know and I'll add them as extra dependencies.\n",
