    "body": "@tgamblin @BarrySmith \r\n\r\nI recently added an alquimia package to the barry/xsdk branch, but it's not working.  The alquimia install depends on the environment variables PETSC_ARCH and PETSC_DIR, which obviously don't exist.  How can we record that information, generated during the PETSc install, for later use in the alquimia install?",
