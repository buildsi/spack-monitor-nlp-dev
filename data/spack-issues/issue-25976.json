    "body": "- Changed mesa-demos to no longer depend on ```mesa``` directly. Now depends on ```gl``` with ```osmesa``` and ```glx``` variants.\r\n- Changed ```provides('gl@:x.x', when='@x.x:)``` to ```provides('gl@:x.x', when='@x.x)``` for all versions except most recent. The former version would not be solvable because of conflicting variants.",
