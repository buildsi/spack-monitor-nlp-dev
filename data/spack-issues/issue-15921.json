    "body": "I have a cmake build which uses a module package in `packages.yaml` which fails (in the cmake configuration phase). If I source the environment `spack-build-env.txt` I see that the module looks loaded, however the build is still broken (as expected). However, if I unload and reload the module the cmake configuration works properly. Comparing the outputs of `declare -px` from the before and after state I see there are a few differences including the `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install pumi simmodsuite=full\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output.
