    "body": "As a user of Spack I want the minimum required version to be correctly reported in the template header of each module file so that there will be a compatibility check by the module run-time.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nAs we will be adding features to `tcl` module files that are not supported by all versions of the tool, we should set the correct minimum required version in the module file headers.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe feature is described [here](https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MIGRATING.html#express-modules-compatibility-of-modulefile-with-versioned-magic-cookie) in the docs. Currently I see two possible implementations of this feature:\r\n\r\n1. The minimum version is inferred implicitly from the features used in `modules.yaml`\r\n2. The minimum version is set explicitly by the user in `modules.yaml` and errors are reported early if the same configuration uses features that are not supported at that version\r\n\r\nI would lean towards the second approach, as it is more explicit to the user and won't cause unexpected bumps of the minimum required version stemming from modifications of `modules.yaml`.\r\n\r\n",
