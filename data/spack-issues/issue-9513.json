    "body": "Fix/avoid GCC builds with newer, breaking ISL versions.\r\n\r\nHaving major-version open bounds on dependencies is imho prune to fail often when dependencies get new versions. In GCC, this is \"often\" the case with ISL.\r\n\r\nThe other basic dependencies (`gmp`, `mpfr`, `mpc`) are at the same risk and span several major releases already, but luckily seem to work in the GCC releases we currently use from spack.\r\n\r\nMore background:\r\nThe [current GCC homepage](https://gcc.gnu.org/install/prerequisites.html) advertises to just go with ISL 0.15 (or newer) and the auto-boundle install scripts (ftp://gcc.gnu.org/pub/gcc/infrastructure/) ship at latest ISL 0.18. If it were essential to have the latest cutting-edge deps for reasons, I guess GCC devs would state it.",
