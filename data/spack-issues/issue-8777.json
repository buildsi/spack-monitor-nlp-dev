    "body": "This changes the `spack checksum` and `spack create` commands to generate `sha256` hashes instead of `md5` hashes.  New packages should start using `sha256` instead of `md5` as we transition, per [NIST guidelines](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Hash-Functions/NIST-Policy-on-Hash-Functions).\r\n\r\nAlso, while Spack still allows packages to write versions like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    version('1.0', '2842bab891cfbf3269a3c4bd8f22fef23c9a15a790ba48c6490730cb51ce9b0e')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis change makes `spack create` and `spack checksum generate code like this:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    version('1.0', sha256='2842bab891cfbf3269a3c4bd8f22fef23c9a15a790ba48c6490730cb51ce9b0e')\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think this makes the packages easier to read, if not to write.  New users will at least have something they can google now (`sha256`) rather than just seeing an uninterpretable hash string.\r\n\r\nFinally, this removes some references to `md5` in the code and docs.  In doing so updates the long-outdated docs for `PackageBase` to something shorter that will hopefully have a bit more longevity.\r\n\r\n- [x] Update `spack checksum` and `spack create` to use `sha256` (via `spack.util.web`)\r\n- [x] Update docs and code to remove references to `md5` (though we keep it in some of the tests)",
