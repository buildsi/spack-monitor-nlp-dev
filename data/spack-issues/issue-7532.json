    "body": "* Fix a bug when checking for 'xl' or 'xl_r' compiler.\r\n* Add support for parallel build - the 's', 'c', 'd', and 'z' targets\r\n  are build separately allowing parallel builds.\r\n* When build '+shared', inject all dependencies into the link lines of\r\n  the mumps libraries.\r\n* Run the examples only when installing with the '--test' Spack option.\r\n\r\nThis should resolve #3006. The issue in #7309 seems to not be resolved.\r\n\r\nNote: there is no list of maintainers in the package, so I'm not sure who to cc here.",
