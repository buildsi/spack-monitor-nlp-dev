    "body": "This is a minimal set of edits to get parallel installs as implemented in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/13100 working with environments.\r\n\r\nWhat it currently does:\r\n\r\n* adds a lock file for an environment that is stored in the environment directory\r\n* adds `Environment.write_transaction`\r\n* makes use of `Environment.write_transaction` in `cmd.install`\r\n\r\n(UPDATE: now passing) ~One test is currently failing, which I think is an issue with the testing framwork vs. the actual logic (since I cannot manually reproduce the error when manually running through commands executed in the test).~\r\n\r\nTODOs\r\n\r\n- [x] fix the test\r\n- [x] (lower priority) synchronize other actions like `spack add`, `spack rm` etc.; this isn't strictly necessary for correcting parallel Spack installs but it should be done (perhaps later)\r\n- [x] introduce similar logic to `Database.write_transaction` to `Environment.write_transaction`, which would include re-reading the environment (this would possibly allow moving the transaction logic from `cmd.install` to `Environment`",
