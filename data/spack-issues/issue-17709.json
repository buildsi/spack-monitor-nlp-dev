    "body": "A bug was introduced in #13100 where ChildErrors would be redundantly printed when raised during a build. We should eventually revisit error handling in builds and figure out what the right separation of responsibilities is for distributed builds, but for now just skip printing.\r\n\r\n- [x] SpackErrors were designed to be printed by the forked process, not by the parent, so check if they've alreaady been printed.\r\n\r\n@tldahlgren: FYI",
