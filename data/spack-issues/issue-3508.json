    "body": "I'm managing two clusters, one of which runs CentOS 6 while the other runs CentOS 7. With a `packages.yaml` like:\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  flex:\r\n    paths:\r\n      flex@2.5.37 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64: /usr\r\n      flex@2.5.35 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64: /usr\r\n    buildable: False\r\n```\r\nthings work great on CentOS 7. But on CentOS 6, I'm seeing:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec flex\r\n...\r\n==> Error: The spec 'flex' is configured as not buildable, and no matching external installs were found\r\n```\r\nIf I had to guess, I bet it's choosing `flex@2.5.37` because it's newer, and then getting an error because `arch=linux-centos7-x86_64` says it isn't for CentOS 6.",
