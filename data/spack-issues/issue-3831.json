    "body": "Since Mercurial is built with python, it is highly recommended to use the python modules as the build.  However, Spack builds its own python and tries to import its own python module.  This is a big problem when Spack is calling system-installed hg, throwing an error due to the mismatch.  I strongly recommend that Spack should build its own hg when it builds its own python.",
