    "body": "This PR allows `spack external find intel-oneapi-mpi` to find and determine the version of the package *provided* that version is one listed in the package.\r\n\r\nIt has been manually tested on the  UO `saturn` and `jupiter` machines.  It will find the version on the former but does not detect the one on the latter (since it is a beta version).  It *could* use the exe path if that is deemed appropriate but I will leave that decision up to the experts.",
