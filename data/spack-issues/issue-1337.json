    "body": "The following change from #378 broke dependency resolution in R packages.\n\n```\n -        for d in extension_spec.traverse():\n +        for d in extension_spec.traverse(deptype=nolink, deptype_query='run'):\n```\n\nAfter a package is built for R it loads it in a session. It is required that the dependency chain be on the R_LIB path for that to succeed. That broke with the above change and so all second level dependencies would have to be specified as direct dependencies. That then makes dependency specification out of sync with what is on CRAN.\n\nI have another change that I need to make to the R package and I can revert the above change in that PR. However, the above change was also made for the python and lua packages and I do not know if there is a similar issue with those.\n",
