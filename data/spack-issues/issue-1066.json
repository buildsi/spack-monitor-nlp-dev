    "body": "Right now the external packages listed in the `packages.yaml` configuration file return immediately from `Package.do_install`:\n\n``` python\n...\n        # No installation needed if package is external\n        if self.spec.external:\n            tty.msg(\"%s is externally installed in %s\" %\n                    (self.name, self.spec.external))\n            return\n...\n```\n\nThis means that they don't trigger any kind of post-install hook (i.e. no module file gets generated for them) and they don't get registered in the `index.yaml` DB. \n\nI would like to change the behavior so that external packages are treated mostly like normal packages, in particular : \n- external packages will be added to the DB (recording information on whether they are external or not)\n- post-install hooks are triggered for them (and module files get generated)\n\nCan this be of interest for reintegration into `develop`? \n",
