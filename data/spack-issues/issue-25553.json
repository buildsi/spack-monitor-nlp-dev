    "body": "This PR adds a `tls` multi-valued variant to the `curl` package, similar to `wget`'s `ssl` variant. It also adds support for building `curl` with other TLS backends (gnutls, mbedtls, nss). Tested by building `curl tls=secure_transport,openssl platform=darwin`.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't technically need to be a MVV, not sure if @alalazo has any preference. \r\n\r\nFixes #25552 @eschnett ",
