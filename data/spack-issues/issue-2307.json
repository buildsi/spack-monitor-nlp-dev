    "body": "Fixes #2306\r\n\r\nAny dependency specified on the command line ended up with the build\r\nand link deptypes unconditionally. This makes it so for example if\r\ncmake is mentioned as a dependency it gets the build deptype only.\r\n\r\nI need to make sure this handles keeping dependents and dependencies in sync. Otherwise I think it is close",
