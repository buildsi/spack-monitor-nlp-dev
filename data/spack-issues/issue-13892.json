    "body": "It would be convenient to be able to load the highest available version of the package. E.g., if I have multiple versions of MPICH installed (for testing against older version), and I don't want to remember or lookup, which is the latest one, to just use it for a project, it would be nice to just say `spack load mpich@MAX`, or something equivalent, and load the latest version.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, maybe loading the \"preferred version\" would be easier, i.e., whatever would get installed if I said `spack install mpich`.\r\n\r\nI don't know if this is already possible, and I just can't find how to do, or if it's too minor of a feature to be relevant, but I thought I'd raise it for discussion.",
