    "body": "This PR adds the py-meshio package, a python package for reading and writing various mesh file formats.\r\n\r\nI only added the latest release (5.0.0) since this is the one I'm using. meshio uses a `setup.cfg` and a `pyproject.toml` file for setup, instead of a `setup.py`, but spack is currently not able to handle this type of configuration-based setup. Hence, I added a patch that adds a 3-line `setup.py` file for setuptools to use.",
