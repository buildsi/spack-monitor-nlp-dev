    "body": "I had an old Microsoft Access Database file that I wanted to use, but QGIS doesn't support `.mdb` files. Apparently ArcGIS does, but ArcGIS doesn't support macOS/Linux. This driver allowed me to use `ogr2ogr` to convert it to a shapefile.\r\n\r\nGDAL also supports MDB Tools for this purpose, but it sounds like MDB Tools has been unmaintained for quite some time.\r\n\r\nDepends on #8613.\r\n\r\n@michaelkuhn @neilflood @citibeth may be interested in this.",
