    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nWe would like to ensure that clingo is able to bootstrap from a python 2.6-only, C++11-only environment in #20159.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n\r\n- Add multiple patches which will allow python 2.6 to be built even with `~ssl` and `~dbm`.\r\n- Modify the `libtirpc` transitive dependency so that its headers are visible to python (this is necessary to make the build pass).\r\n- Pass `--no-user-cfg` only if the python version is >2.6.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n\r\n- These modifications to the `python` package allow it to be built within spack (tested on CentOS 6 with the x86 architecture).\r\n- This makes it easier to test python 2.6 compatibility in arbitrary environments.\r\n\r\n### TODO\r\n- [ ] **This should be added to spack CI.** I'm not 100% sure how to do that yet, but I think that basing this on top of #20207 might be a way to get started on it.",
