Retrieve the spack source:\r\n```console\r\n$ git clone git@github.com:spack/spack.git\r\n```\r\n\r\n2\\. Create the following config files (attached) within Spack's site configuration scope location, `$(prefix)/etc/spack`: \r\n - compilers.yaml\r\n - packages.yaml\r\n - spack.yaml\r\n\r\n3\\.  Amend the hypre recipe file (patch attached). This is necessary to A) Make sure that a CUDA installation is actually available before proceeding with a `+cuda` build, and B) To provide a variant for Unified Memory support.\r\n\r\n4\\. Attempt to build:\r\n```console\r\n$ cd spack\r\n$ source ./share/spack/setup-env.sh\r\n$ spack env activate -d ./etc/spack\r\n$ spack concretize -f\r\n$ spack install -v\r\n```\r\n\r\nDependencies install fine, but the `hypre` build fails at the end with:\r\n```console\r\n>> 877    /usr/tce/packages/xl/xl-2021.03.11-cuda-11.2.0/xlC/16.1.1/bin/.orig/xlc++_r: warning: 1501-228 input file \"-I/usr/tce/packages/cuda/cuda-11.2.0/nvidia/bin/../targets/ppc64le-linux/include\" not found\r\n>> 878    /usr/tce/packages/xl/xl-2021.03.11-cuda-11.2.0/xlC/16.1.1/bin/.orig/xlc++_r: warning: 1501-228 input file \"/usr/tce/packages/cuda/cuda-11.2.0/nvidia/bin/crt/link.stub\" not found\r\n     879    make[1]: *** [Makefile:101: libHYPRE.so] Error 252\r\n     880    make[1]: Leaving directory '/tmp/quellyn/spack-stage/spack-stage-hypre-develop-i57trtg5\r\n            2xpru34ixyliuebi3metda3x/spack-src/src/lib'\r\n     881    make: *** [Makefile:86: all] Error 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nConfusingly, the missing files referenced are in fact present on the system:\r\n```console\r\n$ ls -ld /usr/tce/packages/cuda/cuda-11.2.0/nvidia/bin/../targets/ppc64le-linux/include/\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 10 root root 8192 Mar 30 13:44 /usr/tce/packages/cuda/cuda-11.2.0/nvidia/bin/../targets/ppc64le-linux/include/\r\n\r\n$ ls -la /usr/tce/packages/cuda/cuda-11.2.0/nvidia/bin/crt/link.stub\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 6260 Feb 15 10:59 /usr/tce/packages/cuda/cuda-11.2.0/nvidia/bin/crt/link.stub\r\n```\r\nIt's especially interesting to note that the `hypre` build does *not* fail on a similar architecture, the LANL Darwin cluster's Power9 nodes. There are toolchain differences between RZAnsel and Darwin:\r\n\r\nDarwin Power9 (build succeeds):\r\n- IBM XL 16.1.1.7 and Spectrum MPI 10.3.0.1\r\n- GCC 8.3.0\r\n- CUDA 11.0\r\n\r\nRZAnsel (build fails):\r\n- IBM XL 16.1.1.10 and Spectrum MPI 10.3.1.03rtm0\r\n- GCC 8.3.1\r\n- CUDA 11.2.20\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2238-5d88f439f3\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.2\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-power9le\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n[hypre-fail.rzansel.tar.gz](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6328394/hypre-fail.rzansel.tar.gz)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
