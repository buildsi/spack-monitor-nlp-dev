    "body": "This lets spack.\\* modules be importable into a bare Python.  The `lib/spack/spack/tests/importing.sh` will run through all modules to test they can be imported without error.  For in-source testing, `PYTHONPATH` must add `lib/spack`.\n\nThis also moves the backport and override modules to be under `spack.util`.  \n\nNote, this does not address the location variables in `spack/__init__.py`.\n",
