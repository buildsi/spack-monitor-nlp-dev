    "body": "The vcftools package was installing its Perl libraries into a directory in the staging directory named 'lib', instead of installing them into `prefix.lib` because I was passing a silly value to the `--with-pmdir`option.\r\n\r\nThe result was that any attempt to run one of the scripts in the package failed with something like:\r\n\r\n> Can't locate VcfStats.pm in @INC (you may need to install the\r\n> VcfStats module) [...]\r\n\r\nThis fix provides the correct information in `configure_args`.\r\n\r\nTested lightly on CentOS 7.",
