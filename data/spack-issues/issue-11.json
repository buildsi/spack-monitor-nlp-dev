    "body": "Hi,\n\nThis is a question about how virtual dependencies work.  On the develop branch, if run:\n\n$ spack providers mpe\nmpe2\n\n... as expected. \n\nIf I then (arbitrarily) edit var/spack/packages/zlib/package.py and insert\n\n\"provides('mpe')\"\n\n(I know zlib doesn't do this)\n\nand then run:\n\n$ spack providers mpe\n    zlib\n\nbut there's now no mention of 'mpe2'.\n\nIs this as intended?  Should I be adding more detailed version information to the virtual deps?\n\nThis is just a test example -- the case I'm thinking of is that, say, blas could be provided by atlas, openblas, mkl, acml,\n\nDarach\n",
