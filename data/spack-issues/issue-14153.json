    "body": "Closes #13620\r\nCloses #13265\r\nFixes #13237\r\n\r\nSpack computes a \"full hash\" of packages as part of identifying them when retrieving binary packages for installation. The full hash includes a content hash that attempts to traverse the AST of a `package.py` file and include only the components that are used for the spec (e.g. if a patch is not applied for a particular spec version, then it is excluded from the content hash).\r\n\r\nThis AST examination fails in some cases where the \"when\" condition for a patch/phase is not a string literal. At this time `swig` is such an example. This PR updates the package hash calculation logic to fall back to including content when it cannot evaluate a `when` condition (even though it may not strictly be required by the spec).",
