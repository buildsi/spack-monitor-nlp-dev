    "body": "Apple's gcc is really clang. We previously ignored it by default but there was a regression in #17110.\r\n\r\nOriginally we checked for all clang versions with this, but I know of none other than `gcc` on macos that actually do this, so limiting to `apple-clang` should be ok.\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix check for `apple-clang` in `gcc.py` to use version detection from `spack.compilers.apple_clang`\r\n- [x] regression test",
