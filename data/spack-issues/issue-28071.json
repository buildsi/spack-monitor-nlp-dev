It's kind of clean, but if you look at v8.3.0 or the others, it's not clear why this [`local_installers` directory](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/cudnn/v8.3.1/local_installers) exists from the [release notes](https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/cudnn/release-notes/rel_8.html).  I kind of anticipate that this `local_installers` directory may not be incorporated in their next release.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `spack info cudnn` the urls for the older archives appear valid (can `wget` them and resolve / start downloading), but I am not sure about the new urls -- I only get the url reported for `x86_64`.  Note the change to `sys_key` local variable, the [v8.3.1 // cuda 11.5 installer directory](https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/redist/cudnn/v8.3.1/local_installers/11.5/) contains:\r\n\r\n-  cudnn-linux-ppc64le-8.3.1.22_cuda11.5-archive.tar.xz 822MB 2021-11-23 01:09\r\n- cudnn-linux-sbsa-8.3.1.22_cuda11.5-archive.tar.xz 819MB 2021-11-23 01:09\r\n- cudnn-linux-x86_64-8.3.1.22_cuda11.5-archive.tar.xz 818MB 2021-11-23 01:10\r\n\r\nThe one that concerns me is `sbsa`, the version dictionary is using `Linux-aarch64`, but I haven't the slightest clue how to test this code or even what these architectures are :upside_down_face: ",
