    "body": "Hi, for pull requests when I tried having the download URL in the package.py file as a link to a tar.bz2 file, it gave me an error in the Travis.CI  build saying unable to recognize a tar file, when I changed the link to a tar.gz file of the same source and everything, it was able to pass that check. In the readthedocs documentation, it uses a tar.bz2 file as an example of the archive fetched with the `spack create` command. This seems to be a problem with Travis.CI, but I'm wondering if there is a fix in the Travis.CI config that may fix this? Anyways, just something I wanted to divert your attention to because lots of new packages may have the Travis CI check failed for that particular reason.",
