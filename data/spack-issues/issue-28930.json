Permutter is x86-64. We don't need and wouldn't use libffi there. I.E. if you just remove FFI from the spack dependency chain, ADIOS, SST and all dependencies should build and work fine. I'm not sure if that kind of conditional dependency can be expressed in spack.\r\n\r\ncc @eisenhauer @chuckatkins @pnorbert this libffi build issue breaks the build for ADIOS with SST, which relies on `libffi`, for Perlmutter in the HPE/Cray `PrgEnv-nvidia` programming environment.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nPerlmutter (NERSC) x86-64\r\n\r\nCompiling on Linux using the NVHPC (former: PGI) compilers:\r\n(Free download from Nvidia is here: https://developer.nvidia.com/nvidia-hpc-sdk-downloads)\r\n\r\nC Compiler: `nvc`\r\nC++ Compiler: `nvc++`\r\n\r\nCC E4S: @shahzebsiddiqui\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\r\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
