    "body": "This PR adds the +numpy variant in the boost package.\r\n\r\nThe Boost.NumPy library is particular: it is not enabled by a build flag when building boost; it is instead enabled automatically when Boost.Python is built and boost detects that Numpy is present on the targeted Python installation. Hence the `+numpy` variant needs the `+python` variant to be active, and it depends on the `py-numpy` package.",
