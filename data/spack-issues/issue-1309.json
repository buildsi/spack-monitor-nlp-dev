    "body": "This implements default concretization preferences for Spack by adding a new configuration scope.  The intent is that defaults should be versioned with Spack but NOT conflict with site preferences. \n- Default scope is versioned with spack and can be overridden by site or user configs.\n- Default scope provides sensible default concretization preferences for all of Spack.\n\nTBD in a follow-on PR:\n- per-platform concretization scope can be added later (to force a particular MPI on, e.g., Cray systems).\n- make `jpeg` a virtual dependency and add an order of preference for its implementations.\n\n@adamjstewart @eschnett @davydden @alalazo: anything missing?\n",
