    "body": "As a member of the community I want the top issues to be labeled so that I can quickly track which features or bug-fixes are the most requested.\r\n\r\n**Rationale**\r\nThis can be an effective way for a contributor to select something to work on that can have the most impact on the community. \r\n\r\n**Alternatives**\r\nGithub already permits to sort issues by the number of the various reactions. Using a bot can be  nonetheless an improvement as:\r\n- It labels issues, so that we can keep track of historical information e.g. if some issue has been in the top 10 at some point\r\n- We will develop an habit, as a community, to vote for features or bug fixes we care the most\r\n\r\nN.B. In case we want to merge the PR, this [bot](https://probot.github.io/apps/topissues/) needs to be activated first by an owner of the repository.",
