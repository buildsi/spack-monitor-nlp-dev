    "body": "Fixes #9014 \r\n\r\nThe problem was that the package hardcoded the BLAS library to `libblas.a`, but OpenBLAS has a differently named BLAS library. This PR should be much more robust.\r\n\r\n@yrevaz Can you see if this solves your problem? I'm still waiting for OpenBLAS to install so I can test this myself.",
