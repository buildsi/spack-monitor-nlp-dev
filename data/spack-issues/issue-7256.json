    "body": "These new properties are handled exactly as the `headers` and `libs` properties. The default handlers simply combine the `headers` and `libs` properties of all link dependencies, similar to how the `rpath` package property works.\r\n\r\nI will add another PR that uses (and illustrates) these new properties in the `mfem` package and some of its dependencies.\r\n\r\nEdit: the other PR is #7257.",
