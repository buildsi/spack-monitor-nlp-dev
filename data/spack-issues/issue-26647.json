    "body": "Installing bcl2fastq2 on a CentOS 8.3 Linux machine fails when building the boost dependency at the 1.54.0 version defined in the spec. This is apparently due to the fact that recent versions of glibc always assume int64_t support.\n\nManually doing a spack edit to change from 1.54.0 to 1.55.0 allows boost to build and bcl2fastq2 to complete the install.",
