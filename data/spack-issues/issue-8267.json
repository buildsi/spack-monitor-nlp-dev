    "body": "Fixes: https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/8258\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/pull/8090 altered import behavior so that `import spack` no longer provides access to many other Spack modules. This addresses a case which depended on the prior behavior and was not updated as part of #8090. This particular import error only came up when users were setting compiler flags on specs.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/8194",
