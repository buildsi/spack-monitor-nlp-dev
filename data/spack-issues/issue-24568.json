    "body": "Some of our clusters have an older installation of libtorque and tm.h that are *not* from OpenPBS. (It's apparently TORQUE 3.0.2, possibly from 2008ish.) Using the current openpbs dependency for openmpi causes concretization errors due to restrictions on older python and hwloc requirements that don't apply, even with an external non-buildable installation. The new 'torque' bundle package allows users to point to that external installation without problems.\r\n\r\n@skosukhin It looks like you added the OpenPBS package and the explicit dependency in `openmpi schedulers=tm`, so please let me know if I'm missing something. Thanks!",
