    "body": "The mpich package does not build with gcc 10. gcc 10 enforces the Fortran standard, which reports argument mismatches for certain MPI calls. This issue is well known; see e.g. https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html and https://lists.mpich.org/pipermail/discuss/2020-January/005863.html. The work-around is to add -fallow-argument-mismatch to FCFLAGS when building mpich, and presumably also when using mpich with a Fortran compiler.\r\n",
