    "body": "@scheibelp @tgamblin \r\nI've created a Spack Environment, used `spack -e ... add`, then `spack -e ... concretize -f`.  Now BEFORE I use `spack - ... install`, I would like to print out and inspect the fully concretized environment.  (Basically, repeat the output of `spack -e ... concretize` without actually doing anything).\r\n\r\nIs there a command to do this?  Logically, `spack -e ... spec` with no additional arguments should do it.",
