    "body": "The format of the HPE/Cray supplied module for cray-mvapich2 on HPE apollo systems is\r\nvery different from the cray-mpich module supplied on Cray EX and XE\r\nsystems.\r\n\r\nRecent changes to the cray-mpich package -\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/pull/23470\r\n\r\nbroke support for cray-mvapich2 and relies now on the structure of the\r\ncray-mpich module to work properly.\r\n\r\nRather than try to support two very different vendor mpich modules\r\nusing the same spack package, just add another one specialized for\r\nthe cray-mvapich2 module.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: Howard Pritchard <hppritcha@gmail.com>",
