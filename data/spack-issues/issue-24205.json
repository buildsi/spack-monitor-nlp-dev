    "body": "Hello Spack team,\r\n\r\nI am facing an odd concretization behavior with the new concretizer. When I try to install `netcdf-c ~mpi` Spack is picking `libc` as the iconv provider. But the default variant for libc is `~iconv` so it does not provide the iconv libraries. As a result, the build for `netcdf-c~mpi` and a host of other packages fail.\r\n\r\nIn my packages.yaml, I have ONLY libiconv as the iconv provider:\r\n```\r\n# packages.yaml ....\r\n      golang: [gcc]\r\n      iconv: [libiconv]\r\n      ...\r\n```\r\nBut if I ask: `spack providers iconv`, I get:\r\n```\r\niconv:\r\nlibc  libiconv\r\n```\r\nOddly, the new concretizer picks libiconv as the provider when installing `netcdf-c+mpi`, but picks `libc~iconv` as the provider when installing `netcdf-c~mpi`.\r\n\r\n**Expected Behavior:**\r\nClingo picks `libiconv` as the `iconv` provider in both cases.\r\n",
