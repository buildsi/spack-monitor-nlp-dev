    "body": "This adds a global command line option to specify additional configuration directories. The argument either takes a directory path, or a combination of package and sub-directory. This form fits in with suggestions from @citibeth for package level `package.yaml` files. Examples:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack --config path/to/config/dir install myapp\r\n==> Adding configuration scope 'config/dir'\r\n...\r\n$ spack --config myapplication:dir install myapp\r\n==> Adding configuration scope 'application:dir'\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nSome juggling of when to add sub-command arguments was required so that they were aware of the new scopes. Note, that the short form of this argument, `-c`, conflicts with the `--color` command added by me in #3013. On reflection this command should claim the `-c` form, and the other command only use `--color`, `--no-color`, though I am open to suggestions.\r\n\r\nThere are no tests associated with this PR, but I could write a test suite that repeatedly calls spack using `subprocess` and checks the output, if that is acceptable.",
