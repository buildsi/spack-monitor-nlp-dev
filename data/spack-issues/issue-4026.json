    "body": "I recently tried to uninstall all of my installed packages, but ran into an error message (possibly because I have packages installed from other branches and have been updating my branch). I manually deleted all of my Spack installations and tried running `spack reindex`, but everything is still there. `spack install` properly reinstalls packages, but commands like `spack find` and `spack activate` still point to the old installations. I thought `spack reindex` was supposed to fix this?",
