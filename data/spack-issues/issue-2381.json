    "body": "Fixes #2362, see https://github.com/nir0s/distro/issues/151 for further discussion.\r\n\r\nIt looks like we were previously using distro 0.6.0, the latest release on GitHub. Unfortunately, this release had a bug in it, where it tried to decode the output of `lsb_release -a` into ASCII. This caused problems with Fedora 19 (a.k.a Schr\u00f6dinger\u2019s Cat) which has non-ASCII characters.\r\n\r\nThe latest release on PyPi (1.0.1) fixes this issue by using UTF-8 instead of ASCII for decoding. I also applied the patch from https://github.com/nir0s/distro/pull/148, so it should be good to go.\r\n\r\n@jgalarowicz This should fix your problem.",
