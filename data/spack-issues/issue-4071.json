    "body": "`miniconda[23]` provide overlapping commands and should not both be `module loaded` simultaneously.\r\n\r\nI'd like to avoid user-foot-shooting and disallow this.\r\n\r\nLmod has a [conflict](http://lmod.readthedocs.io/en/latest/050_lua_modulefiles.html) command that might be useful, but I'm not sure how to get at it from the respective packages.\r\n\r\nSpack's [`conflicts`](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html?highlight=setup_environment#conflicts) seems to address other issues (build time) and I don't think that it's relevant.\r\n\r\nIs there a standard way to express this relationship in a package and get it into the modulefiles?\r\n\r\nThanks!",
