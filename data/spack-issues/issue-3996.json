    "body": "Fixes #3979.\r\n\r\n- add Version.__format__ to support new-style formatting.\r\n- Python3 doesn't handle this well -- it delegates to\r\n  object.__format__(), which raises an error for fancy format strings.\r\n- not sure why it doesn't call str(self).__format__ instead, but that's\r\n  hwo things are.\r\n\r\n@junghans: This fixes the first issue from #3979, but I can't reproduce the second.  Do you see the second issue on current develop?\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart: something to watch out for with fancier use of `format()` on objects without `__format__`.  I'm not sure I understand why they chose to delegate the call this way in Python3, but they did.",
