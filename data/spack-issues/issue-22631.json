    "body": "fixes #22294\r\n\r\nA combination of the swapping order for global variables and the fact that most of them are lazily evaluated resulted in custom install tree not being taken into account if clingo had to be bootstrapped. This PR fixes that particular issue, but a broader refactor may be needed to ensure that similar situations won't affect us in the future.",
