    "body": "Fixes a bug I introduced in #27798. Before #27798 we ran:\r\n```console\r\n$ python setup.py build --rpath\r\n$ python setup.py install ...\r\n```\r\nAfter #27798 we run `pip install .` which runs:\r\n```console\r\n$ python setup.py install --rpath ...\r\n```\r\nHowever, the `--rpath` flag is only valid for the build phase, not the install phase. After removing `install_options` and changing the deptypes to link, the build succeeds and RPATHs to `unixodbc` correctly, so it seems like `--rpath` isn't needed.",
