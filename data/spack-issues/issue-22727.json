    "body": "- On some machines (in particular MacOSX Catalina), the icpc in some way\r\nutilizes the preprocessor of the associated \"developer tools\" used by\r\nicpc. This leads to, in some cases, a preprocessor claiming support for\r\n__tuple_element_packs, even though icpc (as of version 21.1) can't\r\nactually parse such code. Just use the MPARK_TUPLE_ELEMENT_PACK impl\r\nwith __icc until icpc supports it, to avoid issues with developer tools\r\nthat are untested.\r\n- The same patch has been PRed against mpark-variant",
