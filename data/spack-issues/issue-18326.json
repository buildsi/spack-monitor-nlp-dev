    "body": "db_lock_timeout is currently set to 3 seconds. This is sometimes too short, even on a fast Xeon machine with an SSD.\r\n\r\nWhen running \"spack install cmake\" and \"spack install grpc\" in parallel on a fresh install, then I needed to increase db_lock_timeout to at minimum 8 seconds to not hit the TimeoutError.\r\n\r\nI propose to raise the timeout to 15 seconds (about double that value). This should be a good value to not hit the timeout too easily (at least on fast machines), and still have a reasonable time for erroring out.\r\n\r\npossible label: defaults",
