However, due to details of internal management, patches with different `when` conditions could be applied in an inconsistent order (different orderings between runs of `spack`).\r\n\r\nIt was also possible for dependency patches to be applied in an inconsistent order (although this wasn't the issue with #10851 or #10852). This PR\r\n\r\n* guarantees applying patches in listed order within a package, and\r\n* among all patches (including those applied by dependents) applies them in an order determined by alphabetical ordering of the package names (arbitrary but consistent)",
