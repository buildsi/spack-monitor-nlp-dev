    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nhip@4.1.0 generates a lib name with a dash in the end because cmake can't infer the version number from a tarbal (it assumes git). This can lead to linker errors.\r\n\r\nThere's already a patch for it but it might have to be rebased.\r\n\r\n```\r\npath/to/hip/lib $ ls\r\ncmake  hip_prof_str.h  libamdhip64.so  libamdhip64.so.4  libamdhip64.so.4.1.21134-\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrently the patch is only applied to 4.0.0 and below:\r\n\r\n```python\r\npatch('0003-Improve-compilation-without-git-repo.3.10.0.patch', when='@3.10.0:4.0.0')\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
