    "body": "This is a partial fix for #5564.\r\n\r\nThis package used to trust that `configure` would discover `gmp` from its environment.\r\n\r\nIt's safer to tell it where to find `gmp` explicitly.\r\n\r\nThis does that by adding a configure_args() that provides a `--with-gmp=...` argument for configure.\r\n\r\nLightly tested on CentOS 7.\r\n\r\nI'm still running in to something that looks like #5578.",
