    "body": "@scheibelp  When I upgrade to a new Spack, I now just do a `git clone` and rebuild everything.  That way I don't have useless old versions sticking around.  (OK, I'm not thrilled with the process but it's not the worst either).\n\nQuestion: Can I copy the cache/ directory from the old Spack to the new one?  Is there any possible downside or risk to this?\n",
