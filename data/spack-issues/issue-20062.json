    "body": "It seems `phist` may need `sbang` patching for its build process, as it uses a python script configured by cmake (`fortran_bindings/cfwrapper.py.in`) where the python interpreter generated into the shebang lives in the spack install tree, which may be quite deep, depending on the installation root and any padding.  A recent `phist` build failed with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n[ 23%] Generating phist_kernels.F90, phist_jada.F90, phist_tools.F90, phist_tools_s.F90, phist_tools_d.F90, phist_tools_c.F90, phist_tools_z.F90, phist_kernels_s.F90, phist_kernels_d.F90, phist_kernels_c.F90, phist_kernels_z.F90, phist_core_s.F90, phist_core_d.F90, phist_core_c.F90, phist_core_z.F90, phist_krylov_s.F90, phist_krylov_d.F90, phist_krylov_c.F90, phist_krylov_z.F90, phist_jada_s.F90, phist_jada_d.F90, phist_jada_c.F90, phist_jada_z.F90, phist_precon_s.F90, phist_precon_d.F90, phist_precon_c.F90, phist_precon_z.F90\r\ncd /tmp/root/spack-stage/spack-stage-phist-1.9.3-qw6xyhd7kcq25y5a6pcsgozkrvdu3rwp/spack-build-qw6xyhd/fortran_bindings && ./cfwrapper.py\r\n./cfwrapper.py: 39: ./cfwrapper.py:  Generates the *.F files from the C header files of phist.\r\n    Command line:         python3 cfwrapper.py\r\n    : not found\r\n./cfwrapper.py: 41: ./cfwrapper.py: import: not found\r\n./cfwrapper.py: 42: ./cfwrapper.py: import: not found\r\n./cfwrapper.py: 43: ./cfwrapper.py: import: not found\r\n./cfwrapper.py: 44: ./cfwrapper.py: import: not found\r\n./cfwrapper.py: 45: ./cfwrapper.py: import: not found\r\n./cfwrapper.py: 46: ./cfwrapper.py: import: not found\r\n./cfwrapper.py: 47: ./cfwrapper.py: from: not found\r\n./cfwrapper.py: 49: ./cfwrapper.py: from: not found\r\n./cfwrapper.py: 51: ./cfwrapper.py: Syntax error: \"(\" unexpected\r\nfortran_bindings/CMakeFiles/phist_fort.dir/build.make:109: recipe for target 'fortran_bindings/phist_kernels.F90' failed\r\nmake[2]: *** [fortran_bindings/phist_kernels.F90] Error 2\r\nmake[2]: Leaving directory '/tmp/root/spack-stage/spack-stage-phist-1.9.3-qw6xyhd7kcq25y5a6pcsgozkrvdu3rwp/spack-build-qw6xyhd'\r\nCMakeFiles/Makefile2:3055: recipe for target 'fortran_bindings/CMakeFiles/phist_fort.dir/all' failed\r\nmake[1]: *** [fortran_bindings/CMakeFiles/phist_fort.dir/all] Error 2\r\nmake[1]: Leaving directory '/tmp/root/spack-stage/spack-stage-phist-1.9.3-qw6xyhd7kcq25y5a6pcsgozkrvdu3rwp/spack-build-qw6xyhd'\r\nMakefile:184: recipe for target 'all' failed\r\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nInvestigation showed that the shebang line generated into the `cfwrapper.py` file was longer than the max acceptable 127 characters, and when I simply added the `sbang` line before it, the problem went away.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis occurred in a gitlab CI automated build of the `phist` package.
