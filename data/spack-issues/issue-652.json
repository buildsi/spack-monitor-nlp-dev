    "body": "See PR #650 \n\nFor some reason, after the most recent merges, the symbol cmake is no longer working inside of package.py.  Replacing `cmake(...)` with `which('cmake')(...)` makes it work again.  I don't think this is really the solution.\n\nI can see where `m.cmake` is getting set, so I don't know why it's not available by the time package.py is running.  In the meantime, I will use `which('cmake')` as needed to get stuff built.\n",
