    "body": "Cherry-picked from #25564 so this is standalone.\r\n\r\nWith this PR we can activate an environment in Spack itself, without computing changes to environment variables only necessary for \"shell aware\" env activation.\r\n\r\n1. Activating an environment:\r\n    \r\n    ```python\r\n    spack.environment.activate(Environment(xyz)) -> None\r\n    ```\r\n    this basically just sets `_active_environment` and modifies some config scopes.\r\n\r\n2. Activating an environment **and** getting environment variable modifications for the shell:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    spack.environment.shell.activate(Environment(xyz)) -> EnvironmentModifications\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThis should make it easier/faster to do unit tests and scripting with spack, without the cli interface.",
