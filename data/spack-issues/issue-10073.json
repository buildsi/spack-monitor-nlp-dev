    "body": "From #9747:\r\n\r\n> Binary caches of packages with absolute symlinks had broken symlinks. From what I can tell, tar doesn't support any notion of matching source/destination roots when unpacking an archive with absolute symlinks. Therefore, this commit just makes a copy of any file that is a symlink while creating a binary cache of a package.\r\n\r\n#9747 caused other binary relocation bugs and was reverted for v0.12.0. This is an alternative solution that avoids the bugs from #9747.\r\n\r\nInstead of copying files for absolute symlinks, we relocate the source path of the symlink. This involves computing the new path, removing the link, and creating a new link with the new path.\r\n\r\n@scottwittenburg @gartung @scheibelp @tgamblin ",
