    "body": "In this case, the bootstrap entered a circular import error when it saw\r\nthat importing clingo needs %gcc. When install_missing_compilers = true,\r\nan attempt to bootstrap a gcc was made, but this fails when no gcc is\r\nfound on the system. This caused a circular import error.\r\n\r\nWhile bootstrapping clingo or other bootstrap packages, enable the check\r\nfor the presence of the needed compiler (override install_missing_compilers)\r\nto not attempt to bootstrap a compiler while not having any compilers.",
