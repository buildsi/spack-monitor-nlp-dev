    "body": "Fixes a bug I introduced in #27798. The pymol package contains monkeypatches to distutils that make it incompatible with setuptools, and therefore incompatible with pip. For now, we should fall back on the old `python setup.py install` method. This lets me build the package successfully.\r\n\r\nAlso added a missing dep and fixed some deptypes.",
