    "body": "The documentation of `depends_on` currently reads:\n\n```\nspack.depends_on(*args, **kwargs)\nCreates a dict of deps with specs defining when they apply.\n```\n\nWe now have multiple dependency types, and package reviewers insist that they be used properly. Consequently I need these to be documented so that I can do that, instead of using `grep` to look for examples.\n",
