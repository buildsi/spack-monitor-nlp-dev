    "body": "I'm trying to build mercurial on macOS but it seems like the certificates aren't properly configured:\r\n```\r\nhg clone https://bitbucket.org/MatthewTurk/rockstar\r\n(an attempt was made to load CA certificates but none were loaded; see https://mercurial-scm.org/wiki/SecureConnections for how to configure Mercurial to avoid this error)\r\nabort: error: [SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed (_ssl.c:661)\r\n```\r\nThis problem was solved for Linux by adding the certificate to `hgrc`, but it doesn't seem to work for macOS. Note that:\r\nhttps://www.mercurial-scm.org/wiki/CACertificates#Mac_OS_X_10.6_and_higher\r\nhas several suggestions for how to solve this problem, but none of them seem to work. They claim that:\r\n\r\n> Mercurial 3.2 or later enables the dummy certificate trick by default.\r\n\r\nbut it doesn't seem to work for our Spack build. When I build mercurial outside of Spack with ananconda python, it works. But when I link to Spack's Python build, it no longer works. Maybe Python isn't built properly either?",
