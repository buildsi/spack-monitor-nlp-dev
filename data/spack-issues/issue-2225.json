    "body": "The default compiler on macOS is GCC, even though I thought it was supposed to be set to Clang. Apparently, there are two places where the default compiler is set, neither of which is in the regular Spack configuration file hierarchy. This PR is an attempt to resolve that.\r\n\r\nI blindly deleted a few things, but I'm not sure what relies on them, so don't expect this to pass any tests. `spack spec` shows that it now defaults to Clang on macOS, so it is working to some extent.",
