    "body": "##### Rationale\n\nI started this because at EPFL we need a way to regenerate module files in production with a bit more control over what gets changed than is currently available.\n##### New sub-commands\n- [x] reworked the extensions to `spack module find` in #721 into `spack module loads`\n- [x] added `spack module rm` to delete module files\n##### `spack module refresh`\n- [x] `spack module refresh` asks for confirmation before refreshing\n- [x] deleting the module file tree is now optional\n##### modules.yaml\n- [x] added a new keyword to `modules.yaml` that influences module file name : hash_length\n##### Fixes\n- [x] reintroduced `path` in `EnvModules` : was lost in a15aee5d8e7bcdd37d9ee25fcf6ded449ef305d5 and prevents `spack module refresh` from working\n##### Other modifications\n- [x] added common cli options in `spack.cmd.commo.arguments` to be reused by multiple commands\n- [x] any `spack module` subcommand accepts a constraint to select subsets of packages\n- [x] `spack module` delete operations now asks user confirmation by default (can be turned off with `-y`)\n- [x] `EnvModules` instances can now skip writing on file name clashes\n- [x] add unit tests to improve the coverage for this command\n\n@tgamblin @glennpj @robertdfrench just pinging you as I think you might be interested in this module related changeset\n",
