    "body": "The `mumps` package was unable to build using the llvm `clang` compiler suite, as it defaulted to using `mpif90` for linking and `mpif90` cannot be used for linking shared library code.  This PR modifies the MUMPS `package.py` to allow it to use IBM XL Fortran for linking.  It also eliminates the need for the existing MUMPS IBM XL patches by having package.py` specify a the compiler-dependent \"shared\" flag to the linker, and always using the compiler suite's Fortran compiler for linking.",
