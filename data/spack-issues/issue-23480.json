    "body": "This should fix some config issues when building geos with python\r\nbindings and using python3 --- the geos configuration scripts had\r\na few python2-isms.\r\n\r\nI only tested (lightly; geos built and I can import geos in python3)\r\non 3.8.1, but I did check that the patch can at least be applied\r\nin 3.5.\r\n\r\nI belatedly discovered that geos dropped all the SWIG bindings\r\nin @3.9, so I also added some conflicts on the +python and +ruby\r\noptions to note that they are not supported in 3.9.\r\n\r\nFixes #23479",
