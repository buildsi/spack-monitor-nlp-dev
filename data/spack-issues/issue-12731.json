    "body": "When I run `spack env activate ...`, Spack automatically adds all of my packages to my `PATH`, but it doesn't set all environment variables. In particular, when I build `gdal+java+mdb`, it adds a lot of Java dependencies to the environment. These dependencies cannot be found unless `CLASSPATH` is set. I could hack Spack Environments to set `CLASSPATH`, but it would be more robust and predictable if Spack Environments set the same env vars that were written to module files.\r\n\r\n@zchen105",
