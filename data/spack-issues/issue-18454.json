    "body": "In my `~/.gitconfig`, I have the following logic:\r\n```\r\n[commit]\r\n    # Automatically sign using GPG keys\r\n    gpgsign = true\r\n```\r\nThis allows me to automatically sign all git commits. However, when I run `spack test`, tests that involve git commits stall with the following message:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack test lib/spack/spack/test/mirror.py\r\n...\r\nPlease enter the passphrase to unlock the OpenPGP secret key:\r\n\"Adam J. Stewart <ajstewart426@gmail.com>\"\r\n4096-bit RSA key, ID C66C0675661156FC,\r\ncreated 2020-03-07.\r\n\r\nPassphrase: \r\n```\r\nThis PR removes that message. Another possible solution would be to pass some flag to git to ignore all local configurations.",
