    "body": "Closes #25784 and #24248\r\n\r\nCurrently the autotools build system tries to pick up config.sub and\r\nconfig.guess files from the system (in /usr/share) on arm and power.\r\nThis is introduces an implicit system dependency which we can avoid by\r\ndistributing config.guess and config.sub files in a separate package,\r\nsuch as the new `gnuconfig` package which is very lightweight/text only\r\n(unlike automake where we previously pulled these files from as a\r\nbackup). This PR adds `gnuconfig` as an unconditional build dependency\r\nfor arm and power archs.\r\n\r\nIn case the user needs a system version of config.sub and config.guess,\r\nthey are free to mark `gnuconfig` as an external package with the prefix\r\npointing to the directory containing the config files:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n    gnuconfig:\r\n      externals:\r\n      - spec: gnuconfig@master\r\n        prefix: /usr/somewhere/config/files\r\n      buildable: false\r\n```\r\n\r\nApart from that, this PR gives some better instructions for users when\r\nreplacing config files goes wrong.\r\n\r\n",
