    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThis is more of an annoyance than a bug. If you are in an environment, do `spack config edit config` to edit its spack.yaml file, and add something erroneous. Spack commands will then fail (which should be expected), but most importantly `spack config edit config` will also fail, preventing the user from going back to their spack.yaml to correct it. The file needs to be opened manually (meaning the user must know where spack stores it).\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack env create myenv\r\nspack env activate myenv\r\nspack config edit config\r\n# then add something incorrect in the environment's configuration\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-4221-0bd77da82f\r\n* **Python:** 3.9.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu21.04-sandybridge\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
