    "body": "@wortiz brought up an interesting issue with the current way we're detecting `-h` (and so on) in #18369 \r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that bug by matching `-h`, `--help`, `--sh`, `--csh`, and `--fish` _exactly_. The old way would identify `<anything>-h` and `-h<anything>`.\r\n\r\nFixes #18369",
