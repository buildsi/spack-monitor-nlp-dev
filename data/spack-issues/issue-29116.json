    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nIt's impossible to match against anything other than an exact architecture in a `when` clause. This requires workarounds e.g. #29087. We would like to be able to e.g. match against any version of Alpine Linux, with something like `arch=linux-alpine*-*`.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Allow matching against `*` for any component of `ArchSpec`.\r\n- Add testing.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\nThe following works on my Alpine Linux installation:\r\n```python\r\n>>> from spack.spec import ArchSpec, Spec\r\n>>> ArchSpec.default_arch()\r\nArchSpec(('linux', 'alpine3', 'zen3'))\r\n>>> ArchSpec.default_arch().satisfies(Spec('arch=linux-alpine*-*').architecture)\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor #29087, this would allow wrapping those `patch(...)` directives within a single `with when('arch=linux-alpine*-*'):` clause instead of having to implement them dynamically with `FilePatch::apply`.",
