None is no longer a valid variant choice for tracing, so spack doesn't want to let me re-use the existing dependency.\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n```\r\n==> Error: invalid values for variant \"tracing\" in package \"glib\": ['']\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've read through the conversation on #9481, and don't see anything that talks about this as an expected outcome, so I assume it was overlooked.\r\n",
