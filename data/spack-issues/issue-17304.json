    "body": "I recently did an in-situ upgrade from Ubuntu 19.04 to 20.04. When I try to install packages for the new OS alongside the old ones, I get a PermissionError. I believe the issue is that the proper `mkdir` command is missing since that directory is owned by me and the base error message is \"Operation not permitted\" (i.e., it's not _really_ a permission error).\r\n\r\n\t$ spack install zlib\r\n\t==> 19225: Installing zlib\r\n\t==> Error: Failed to install zlib due to PermissionError: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/home/tim/workspace/spack/opt/spack/linux-linuxmint20-piledriver'\r\n\t==> Error: [Errno 1] Operation not permitted: '/home/tim/workspace/spack/opt/spack/linux-linuxmint20-piledriver'\r\n\t\r\n\t$ mkdir /home/tim/workspace/spack/opt/spack/linux-linuxmint20-piledriver\r\n\r\n\t$ spack install zlib\r\n\t==> 19333: Installing zlib\r\n\t<snip>\r\n\t==> 19333: zlib: Successfully installed zlib\r\n\t  Fetch: 0.46s.
