    "body": "So I still have an issue of OpenMPI > 1.10.x putting `/usr/lib64` in the mpi wrappers because I am using `--with-verbs` that finds IB libraries in `/usr/lib64` and the compiler I'm using isn't in `/usr/lib64` so the executables I build with OpenMPI 3.1.0, for example have GLIBC errors at runtime. I feel like we should be putting the `extra_rpaths` into the OpenMPI wrappers with rpath as well. I'm just not sure of the best approach. Hoping to find a solution to this so I can use OpenMPI > 1.10.x without hacking the wrappers myself. It really surprises me that I seem to be the only one with this problem though.",
