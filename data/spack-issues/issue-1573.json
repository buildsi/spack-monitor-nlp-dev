    "body": "This adds a package for fastqc.\n\n~~FEEDBACK REQUEST: I need some way to make the fastqc file executable.  `set_executable` only sets the user executable bit, which isnt' what I need in my environment.  This package uses _chmod_ (stolen from the cuda package).  What's the right way.  See also #1483~~\n\nI think that this is ready to go.  I've changed it to install things into neater bin and lib subdirs and am going with the chmod() for now.\n",
