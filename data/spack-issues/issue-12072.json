    "body": "Fixes #11163 \r\n\r\nThe goal of this work is to simplify stage directory structures by eliminating use of symbolic ilnks.  This means, among other things, that `$spack/var/spack/stage` will no longer be the core staging directory.  Instead, the first accessible `config:build_stage` path will be used.  \r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Resolve non-`stage.py` test failures\r\n- [x] Add new test cases\r\n- [x] Address coverage issues\r\n- [x] Update docs\r\n- [x] Integrate use of becker33's \r\n- [x] Resolve mpich test issue\r\n- [x] `mkdirp` change for adjusting permissions associated with the first accessible stage path\r\n",
