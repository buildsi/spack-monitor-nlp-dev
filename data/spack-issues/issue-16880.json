    "body": "Adding another HEP generator recipe.  It works, but there are some remaining questions, for which any suggestions are welcome:\r\n* I could not get the download from the actual hepforge.org site `https://evtgen.hepforge.org/downloads?f=EvtGen-01.07.00.tar.gz` to work (checksum and install). I'm happy to maintain the github mirror I set up instead though.\r\n* There are some optional dependencies on generators that are not in spack yet. Should I comment out those variants for now?\r\n* I needed the `g2c.patch` with gcc 9.3.0. but some cursory research suggests  that older versions of gfortran may need those flags.",
