    "body": "Fixes #28021  (hopefully)\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies the `preferred-test` mock package such that it leverages the repo of a relatively small, stable package with only one version. Doing so results in fewer fetches (1 versus many) during checksum testing, hopefully reducing the window for cleaning up the post-fetch stage directory.\r\n\r\nThe PR also peripherally sets `checksum` arguments to include defaults to be explicit.",
