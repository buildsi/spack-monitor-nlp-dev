    "body": "I'm currently writing a package to install a program. Its Makefile has an `all` target, but no `install` target. Should I tell Spack to build it in prefix, or build it in stage and copy the entire directory to prefix? I don't think there will be symlinks, but I'll have to check. Are there any other packages that currently do this?\n",
