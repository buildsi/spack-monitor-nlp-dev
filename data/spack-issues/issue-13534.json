    "body": "fixes #4382\r\nfixes #8291\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new command called ~`spack autoremove`~ `spack gc` that removes all the specs that were necessary to build other specs but are currently unused. This includes build dependencies and implicit dependency of specs that have been already uninstalled.\r\n\r\nIt provides a useful way to keep the environment clean after an upgrade or to minimize the size of installations within e.g. container images.\r\n\r\n~The name `autoremove` has been selected to be consistent with what `yum` and `apt` use for the same functionality.~",
