    "body": "As a user of Spack I want to be able to set module file permissions either from the command line or from the configuration file so that I can manage the module files tree from within Spack.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nCurrently permissions on module files, if different from the user's default, are set manually outside of Spack. A common use case could be granting access to a proprietary software only to users belonging to a certain group. Spack should be able to perform this operation, either automatically if configured to do so or on demand via the command line.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTo implement this feature we probably need:\r\n\r\n- [ ] A way to declare permissions for module files in `modules.yaml`\r\n- [ ] A way to set permissions from the `spack module ...` subcommands\r\n",
