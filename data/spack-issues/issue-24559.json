    "body": "Hey *,\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use spack in a gitlab-based CI flow which relies on CentOS 7 containers.\r\nThese containers do not resolve usernames correctly, i.e. when calling `getpass.getuser()` I get (at several places):\r\n```\r\n  File \"/opt/rh/rh-python36/root/usr/lib64/python3.6/getpass.py\", line 169, in getuser\r\n    return pwd.getpwuid(os.getuid())[0]\r\nKeyError: 'getpwuid(): uid not found: 1000'\r\n```\r\nAfter applying this (maybe too hacky :)) change `spack` is working again (spack temp folders etc.).\r\n\r\nI guess this might occur in other places (mostly containerized environments?) as well.\r\n\u21d2 Would this (in general) be a valid change or does spack want to enforce a working username resolution? Should I have a look at the other places where this code path might be called?\r\n\r\nCheers,\r\nEric",
