    "body": "New Cray CCE compilers (version 9+) trip over the same bug that XL has issues with (i.e.: a typo in `CBLAS/CMakeLists.txt`).  This PR simply applies the existing patch to the source to fix builds with `%cce@9.0.1.80`.  IMHO, this patch should probably be applied universally as it shouldn't negatively impact builds with other compilers.\r\n\r\nI also opened an issue on the netlib-lapack github page to point out this deficiency: [CMake error CBLAS/CMakeLists.txt wrt FortranCInterface](https://github.com/Reference-LAPACK/lapack/issues/349).",
