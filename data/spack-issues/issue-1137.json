    "body": "often one would like to keep sources of packages so that in case there is  segmentation fault somewhere it is possible to debug and check which line in source file of packages fails, get proper backtraces in a debugger. Currently one can keep the sources after successful install, but they will still be deleted after restart as location is temporary.\n\nI think this issues can be resolved rather easy if instead of creating a temporary system-dependent folder and then symlinking into `/spack/var/stage/`, one could directly unarchive sources and compile inside `/spack/var/stage` and keep them there if needed. This could be controlled by a global or per-install flag.\n",
