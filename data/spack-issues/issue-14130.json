Please describe it!*\r\n\r\nI'd like to provide spack to all multi-user machines, system-wide, preferably having\r\nit in an official Debian package.\r\n\r\n*Describe the solution you'd like and the alternatives you have considered.*\r\n\r\nHaving a Makefile or CMakefile or python3 setup.py to install the spack software, would\r\nbe perfect.\r\n",
