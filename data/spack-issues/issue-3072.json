    "body": "When I try to build `mpc` on Comet, then this fails because it tries to use a system-installed `mpfr` instead of the one that Spack just installed. Spack should pass the respective configure option to point `mpc` to its `mpfr`.\r\n\r\nThis used to work. I assume this is a fall-out from the recent conversion to `AutotoolsPackage` that removed the respective configure options.",
