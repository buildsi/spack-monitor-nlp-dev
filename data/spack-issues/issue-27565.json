Then `at-spi2-core` depends on `dbus`. Finally `dbus` depends on `docbook-xml@4.4`. It explicitly requires docbook-xml version `4.4`. This change was added 4 days ago with [PR#27420](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/27420). \r\n\r\n* On the other hand, all versions of `gtkplus` depends of `librsvg` and it depends on `gtk-doc`. Unfortunately `gtk-doc` depends on `docbook-xml@4.3`. It specifically requires version `4.3`.  This dependency is introduced by [PR#22228](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/22228) 8 months ago.\r\n\r\n* As a result of those above mentioned two dependencies of `gtkplus@3` it cannot be installed due to conflicting `docbook-xml` versions.\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is if it is possible one of the packages should give a range of versions for `docbook-xml` or free it up completely. Sadly non of those `gtkplus`, `gtk-doc` or `dbus` has a maintainer showing up when I did `spack maintainers ...` on them.\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
