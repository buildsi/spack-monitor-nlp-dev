    "body": "@tgamblin @adamjstewart \r\n\r\nThe proposal, initially discussed in #2614, is to move non-free packages (which require, among other things, manual tarball downloads) into a separate `spack-nonfree` Spack repository, under a separate GitHub repo.\r\n\r\nThe GitHub repo `http://github.com/LLNL/spack-nonfree` would have a `repo.yaml` and `packages/` at its top level.  The `repo.yaml` file would specify either `builtin` or `nonfree` namespace (we need to decide this).\r\n\r\nExisting non-free packages would be moved into this new repo: currently `matlab` and `oracle-jdk`, maybe others.\r\n\r\nIs further discussion on this proposal needed?  Is this something that is ready for someone to implement?",
