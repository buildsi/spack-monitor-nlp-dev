    "body": "I think this comes down to a typo somewhere -- spack is attempting to query the version of CC by running `/opt/cray/craype/2.5.4/bin/CC ([Vv]ersion).*(\\d+(\\.\\d+)+)`. I think that argument is a regex that is supposed to be going to a different function call, or perhaps as a different argument in the get_compiler_version method.\n\nTo reproduce on Cori, BlueWaters, or Titan, run `compiler find` with -vd.\n",
