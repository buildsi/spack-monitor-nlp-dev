    "body": "Fix #4126\r\n\r\nThe relationship among different types of variants has been weakened, in the sense that now it is permitted to compare MV, SV and BV among each other. The mechanism that permits this is an implicit conversion of the variant passed as argument to the type of the variant asking to execute a constrain, satisfies, etc. operation.\r\n\r\nThere are two statements in the tests that are commented right now, as they lead to failures. They are under a FIXME comment, and are commented because it may be possible that the failures are legit (but need to discuss this with @tgamblin).",
