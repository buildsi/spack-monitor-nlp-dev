    "body": "Some typically European (Continental) scripts are in some variant of ISO-8859.\r\nThis lead filter_shebang to raise an error on utf-8 decoding.\r\nNow, such files are converted to UTF-8, when posssible ;  if not, there still is an exception.\r\nThis was occuring to perl-tk (in develop) and perl-fth (on a branch).\r\nThe negative impact of this commit is to add a try/except around the decode function.\r\n\r\n",
