    "body": "Removed PGI-specific code in `boost` package that redefined `dirent` to be `dirent64`.  This caused `boost%pgi` to fail as certain function prototypes expected `dirent` instead of `dirent64`.\r\n\r\n`dirent` and `dirent64` structures are defined in `/usr/include/bits/dirent.h` and are identical, depending on whether `__USE_FILE_OFFSET64` is defined.  If not defined, `dirent64` doesn't exist, if defined `dirent64` and `dirent` are identical.  I am unsure what advantage explicitly using the `dirent64` type over `dirent` with the pgi compiler, as the only purpose it seems to serve is prevent compilation.",
