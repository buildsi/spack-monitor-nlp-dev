    "body": "This is probably somewhat related to https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/6245, however this applies to when having used `spack bootstrap` to setup environment-modules as a local user. \r\n\r\nI think this is a general issue in that `spack location` doesn't seem to automatically identify the architecture by default as well. (although this is more of a feature request)\r\n\r\nThe `spack bootstrap` command fails to recognize that the packages are missing for the secondary architectures, and even when I have installed the package manually for the correct architecture, it fails to select the correct path for the installed package when loading the environment in the shell.\r\n\r\nI haven't had time to determine if it is silently failing to load the x86 package on a powerpc system, but I'm getting `module: command not found` errors rather than architecture errors so I suspect it is not loading at all.",
