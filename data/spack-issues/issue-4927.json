    "body": "I'm working on a `SConsPackage` base class and started debugging some SCons builds. I discovered that SCons ignores the `CC` environment variable. If I add `'CC={0}'.format(spack_cc)` to the `serf` build line, it actually uses Spack's compiler wrappers, but I end up seeing the following error message:\r\n```\r\nSpack compiler must be run from Spack! Input 'SPACK_PREFIX' is missing.\r\n```\r\nMaybe SCons purifies the build environment for some reason? We might need a way to work around this. For now I'll tell it to use the actual compilers and manually set `-L` and `-I`.",
