    "body": "closes #5506\r\n\r\nThe application of patches to upstream executables has been reworked according to the suggestions of the main developer in #5506. In particular we are not maintaining a dictionary that maps plumed versions to the versions of patchable executables, and we are using a non-interactive command to patch applications.\r\n\r\nAll the comments on substituting plumed at run-time do not apply here, since we use RPATH and we want to maintain a 1:1 relationship between the DAG hash and the plumed library used.",
