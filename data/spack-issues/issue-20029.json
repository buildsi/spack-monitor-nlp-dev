Without\r\nthe patch, llvm-amdgpu builds, but then rocm-device-libs fails with\r\n\"cannot find -ltinfo.\"\r\n\r\nTighten the version requirements for cmake according to the\r\nllvm/CMakeLists.txt file.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nping @srekolam @arjun-raj-kuppala @haampie\r\n\r\nThe build for rocm-device-libs @3.9.0 was failing with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n>> 62    /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -ltinfo\r\n>> 63    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis patch fixes the build for 3.9.0.  I assume that was the point of\r\nthe original patch for <= 3.8.0.\r\n\r\nAdding an explicit dependency on ncurses to rocm-device-libs would\r\nalso fix the build, but I think this is the better solution.",
