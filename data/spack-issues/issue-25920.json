    "body": "GDB 11.1 has been released: https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/\r\n\r\nUpdate spack to have the latest version.  Required a slight tweak to the INTL patch to get it merge correctly.  It also looks like there is some discussion on the GDB devel list about finally getting this fixed, but it looks like the discussion is still ongoing and we'll still need the patch for now.\r\n\r\nLastly not all GNU Mirrors are up to date with the GDB 11.1 release, so waiting a week to merge this might be a good idea otherwise we may have some spurious download failures.",
