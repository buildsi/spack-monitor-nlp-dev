    "body": "When perl packages are installed, the file `perllocal.pod` is typically updated with details of the package. The file seems to be purely for documentation, and packages do not rely on it for correct operation. However, the presence of the file prevents more than one perl extension from being activated by spack.\r\n\r\nDoes spack provide a way to ignore certain files when activating extensions?",
