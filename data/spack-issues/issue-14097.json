    "body": "### Rationale\r\n\r\nRunning an installation with the `--yes-to-all` flag enabled will still result in yes/no questions requiring user input if Spack has to fetch a package that doesn't have a checksum.  \r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nOption 1: Implicitly enable the `--no-checksum` flag when the `--yes-to-all` flag has been set and specify that this will happen in the `spack install --help` description.\r\n\r\nOption 2: Explicitly state in the `spack install --help` description for the `--yes-to-all` flag that this does NOT set the `--no-checksum` flag and that user input will still be required if a package without a checksum is included in the spec.",
