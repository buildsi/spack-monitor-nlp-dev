    "body": "partially resolves #5428\r\n\r\n- The newest openfoam version requires openmpi+thread_multiple for\r\n  collated output.\r\n\r\nAdded in two safety mechanisms.\r\n\r\n- A spec-level conflict, but also raise an InstallError if the mpi\r\n  provider has resolved to openmpi without the +thread_multiple\r\n  variant. This additional check unfortunately seems to be required\r\n  for the additional openmpi constraint, since openfoam only directly\r\n  depends_on 'mpi', not on 'openmpi'.\r\n\r\n  Without this runtime check, the user could easily compile and\r\n  install with the incorrect openmpi configuration and experience\r\n  various issues with openfoam.",
