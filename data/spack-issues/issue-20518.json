    "body": "This is a similar attempt as #10411, with the broader scope\r\n\r\n<!--*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*-->\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\n1. We have long desired to make a package work in more than 1 type of Spack \"build system\" at a time, e.g. if a package switches from using autotools to cmake. See #12941 for context. https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/12941#issuecomment-538870806 describes the consensus on use cases and tries to lay out one possible solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3. We define our dependency types in terms of other much more granular information here: https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html?highlight=dependency%20type#dependency-types. Why not expose an API for the much more granular information?\r\n\r\n.............\r\n\r\n<!--*Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it!*-->\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Document the meaning of all deptypes\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues/3768#issuecomment-293046651\r\n\r\n*This is about the virtual deps spec syntax, probably remove*\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues/20256#issuecomment-746757043\r\n\r\n\r\n`ComplexResource`\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues/20256#issuecomment-746730384\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues/20256#issuecomment-747110323\r\n\r\nhttps://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html?highlight=dependency%20type#dependency-types\r\n\r\n<!--*Describe the solution you'd like and the alternatives you have considered.*-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n<!--*Add any other context about the feature request here.*-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [ ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
