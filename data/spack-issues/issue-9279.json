    "body": "As requested in #7311, this adds a `setup-env.fish` enabling the same level of user interactivity in fish as in bash. \r\n\r\nSince `setup-env.sh` uses quite a bit of shell magic specific to bash-like syntax, I've had to completely rewrite it for fish. The design is very much based in `setup-env.sh`. I've tested this on a few standard use cases (bootstraping, inspecting packages, installing, loading and unloading with `environment-modules`). I do welcome feedback from more rigorous tests.\r\n\r\nNote that in order to get `environment-modules` to cooperate with fish, I had to upgrade it to >v4.\r\n\r\nCloses #7311",
