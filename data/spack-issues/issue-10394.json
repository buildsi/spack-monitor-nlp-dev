I don't know how to change the grammar appropriately.\r\n\r\nBut it is not complete: it only handles managing the configs and doesn't actually write the spconfig files etc. Depending on your time/preference, this can be folded into #7846 or I can add the rest of #7846 to this.\r\n\r\nAllow user specs to store spec as well as a set of packages in the DAG to manage manually; update install/add commands with --setup option\r\n\r\nThis assumes that the `spack.yaml` stored for environments maintains user specs either as\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack:\r\n  specs:\r\n    - py-numpy\r\n    - openblas\r\n```\r\n\r\n(as before) or as\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack\r\n  specs:\r\n    - spec: py-numpy\r\n      setup: [python]\r\n    - spec: openblas\r\n      setup: []\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis follows the existing environment schema definition (which allows for strings or dictionaries).",
