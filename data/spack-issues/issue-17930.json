    "body": "NVIDIA released its HPC SDK today. It includes the ex-PGI compilers which have been rebranded `nvc`, `nvc++` and `nvfortran`.\r\n\r\nHow do you plan to accommodate this rebranding? Should we keep using the NVIDIA compilers as PGI compilers or should it be new compilers (which might break existing packages since \"%pgi\" wouldn't catch those although it will probably be needed in most cases)?",
