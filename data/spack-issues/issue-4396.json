    "body": "We have a lot of unit tests for Spack, and we use Travis to test several versions of Python 3. But these tests never seem to catch anything. After we added Python 3 support, commands like `spack fetch`, `spack checksum`, and `spack info` didn't work at all for Python 3, but all of our unit tests passed. It occurred to me that perhaps we are not actually testing Python 3 at all. When we run `spack`, isn't it picking up the first `python` in the `PATH`, usually for the system `python2` installation?\r\n\r\n@alalazo @tgamblin ",
