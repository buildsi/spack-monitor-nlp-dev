    "body": "Not sure if this is already in Spack...\r\n\r\nOne potential issue with multi-user Spack is that different people will write files with different ownership and group permissions.  This could result in weird behavior; for example, you're unable to uninstall a package.\r\n\r\nTo solve this problem, Spack needs to ensure all files are written with proper group and umode.  By default, I would want things world-readable and group-writable.  Also, there needs to be a single group used for all Spack files, even if it's not users' default group.  These things should go in `config.yaml`, users should not have to set umode or group in their `.bashrc` to get this correct.\r\n",
