    "body": "@becker33 @scheibelp and others, please tell me how to do a better job writing 'spacky' spack code - this is the first time I have used spack's patch functionality. I did not make an issue to associate with this PR, but if you do\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install hdf5@1.8.10\r\n``` \r\nyou should be able to reproduce the compile errors that this patch fixes. The C language standard that hdf5 wants to be built with (ISO C90?) does not allow '//' comments, only '/* ... */'. Changing from the former to the latter is what the patches in this PR do.",
