    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\n\nI ran the following command with a fresh Spack installation to attempt to create an environment directory. This is a multi-node system and works on the head node, but I get the error message that's included here when I tried on another node. I should also note that this error occurs both on NFS mounted paths and on non-NFS mounted paths. It also happens when the directory `Cardioid-env/` already exists (but the directory `Cardioid-env/`) and when there is no directory there. This also occurs when I just try `spack env create cardioid-env` without a directory. Again, both commands work fine on the head node, but neither works on the other nodes.\r\n```console\r\nspack env create -d Cardioid-env/\r\n```\r\n\n\n### Error message\n\n```console\r\n==> Error: [Errno 39] Directory not empty: '.spack-env'\r\n```\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.16.3-4986-7380161\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ol7-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
