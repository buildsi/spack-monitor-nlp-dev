    "body": "### Rationale\r\n\r\nI think we can improve usability slightly by printing the activation command of an environment after `spack env create` to the terminal. I find myself often creating and then forgettting to immediately activate an environment.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSee Spack's workflow:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack env create test123\r\n==> Updating view at /home/axel/src/spack/var/spack/environments/test123/.spack-env/view\r\n==> Created environment 'test123' in /home/axel/src/spack/var/spack/environments/test123\r\n```\r\n\r\nversus Conda's workflow:\r\n```console\r\n$ conda create -y -n test123\r\n# ... verbose bla bla ...\r\n\r\n# To activate this environment, use\r\n#     $ conda activate test123\r\n# To deactivate an active environment, use\r\n#     $ conda deactivate\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nAdditionally, we could add a `--activate|-a` flag to `env create` to do it in one go.",
