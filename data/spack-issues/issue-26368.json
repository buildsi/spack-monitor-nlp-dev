    "body": "- Added OpenJDK 17 LTS\r\n- Added OpenJDK 11.0.12_7 to Darwin-x86_64\r\n- And I think the preferred version should be OpenJDK 11 by now to prevent problems with software that don't support Java 16/17 yet and also because is a LTS version. I don't really know any software that doesn't work with recent versions of java, but I think it's a safer option. OpenJDK 11 is still supported by Adoptium until at least Oct 2024.",
