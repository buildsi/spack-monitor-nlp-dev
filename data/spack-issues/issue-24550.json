    "body": "Spack run \"vermin\" to determine which Python versions each source file supports. The respective CI output is not very informative:\r\n- It outputs version bounds for all of Spack's Python files. There are many, and almost always, almost all of them are fine. The output would be easier to examine if only the failures were output, or if the failures were either highlighted or repeated at the bottom. The current output says e.g. \"minimum is Python 3.5, expected Python 2.6, this is a failure\", but it doesn't say which source file is causing the problem.\r\n- It doesn't output line numbers for failing source files. This would be quite convenient to have.",
