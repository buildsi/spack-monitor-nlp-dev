    "body": "closes #26306 \r\n\r\nIn certain cases, in particular when working on air-gapped networks, it might be of interest to easily point Spack to an alternative source of software to be used during bootstrapping. This PR introduces two additional subcommands to allow adding and removing bootstrapping sources from Spack's configuration.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] Reworked `bootstrap.yaml` schema to push each source metadata in a separate folder\r\n- [x] Add `spack bootstrap add` and `spack bootstrap remove` to add and remove additional sources of software for bootstrapping   ",
