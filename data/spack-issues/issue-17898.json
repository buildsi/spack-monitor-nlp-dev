    "body": "This includes #17422, but fixes a list of issues with it:\r\n\r\n- no more strict dependency on cmake 3.5, but simply allow 3 and above (required a patch)\r\n- fixes a problem where `rocclr` was built outside of the staging area and then reused in dependents\r\n- fixes compilation of HsakmtRoct which had missing dependencies and flags that made the build fail\r\n- fixes RPATH issues (required a patch for `hsa-rocr-dev` which is also submitted upstream)\r\n- adds a variant for the amd gpu target for rocfft, because hipcc tries to autodetect the gpu target, for which it needs a binary which it assumes to be in a specific folder which we can't have in spack\r\n- Fixes the tests",
