    "body": "Update geant4-data and individual datasets for Geant4 versions 10.6.3 and 10.7.0.\r\n\r\nUpdate geant4 package with new versions 10.6.3 and 10.7.0. Update dependencies on CLHEP and VecGeom with versions required for Geant4 10.7.\r\n\r\nAdd `GEANT4_INSTALL_PACKAGE_CACHE=OFF` to CMake args for 10.6 onwards. Prevents install of the \"package cache\" file that contains hard-coded paths for dependencies, improving relocatability. It relies on Spack setting CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH correctly in build/use environments that consume the geant4 package. This has been tested locally in a simple environment to build a Geant4 example, and appears to function correctly.\r\n\r\nReviewers requested, also pinging @vvolkl and @ChristianTackeGSI for their info.",
