    "body": "The CUDA compiler conflicts are valid on Cray too, and likely on Darwin x86_64 with %gcc and %clang in case you'd build these compilers instead of using apple-clang, so drop platform=linux in the conflicts entirely.\n\nAlso add a note about missing conflicts for %apple-clang on Darwin; the comment there was a bit outdated.\n\nThis PR is not meant to add more conflicts for %apple-clang, since I don't have access to these macos+nvidia machines at all.\n",
