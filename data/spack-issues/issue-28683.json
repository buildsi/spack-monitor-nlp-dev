    "body": "This adds a variant `python +distutils` which can't be turned off\r\nthrough concretization, meaning that all spack installs of python\r\nhave distutils by default.\r\n\r\nOn some Debian systems however, distutils is some sort of shim\r\npackage, and has to be installed separately.\r\n\r\nSo, on those systems we can detect `python ~distutils` through\r\n`spack external find python`, which makes Spack build Python\r\nproperly in some cases (e.g. pip, llvm), instead of throwing\r\ncryptic error messages.",
