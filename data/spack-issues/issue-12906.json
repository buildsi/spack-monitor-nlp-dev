    "body": "Fixes #12905 \r\n\r\nThe output of `subprocess.check_output` is a byte string in Python 3. This causes dictionary lookup to fail later on.\r\n\r\nA try-except around this function prevented this error from being noticed. Removed this so that more errors can propagate out.\r\n\r\n@alalazo @tgamblin @becker33 ",
