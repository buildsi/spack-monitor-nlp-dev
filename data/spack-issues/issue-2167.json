    "body": "The changes in this pull request make the following improvements to the `visit` and `vtk` packages:\n- Link `visit` explicitly with the Spack-installed `vtk` during installation.\n- Add `qt+/~webkit` handling support to the `vtk` package.\n- Add a general `url_for_version` method to the `vtk` package.\n- Update all string replacement operations to use `format` instead of `%`.\n- Remove a couple of weird line indentation issues introduced during the style update (see #1496).\n\nI've verified that the `visit@2.10.3` and `vtk@6.1.0~opengl2 ^qt@4.8.6+/~webkit` variants of these packages compile and install properly on CHAOS when compiling with `gcc@4.7.2`.  Please let me know if there are any problems with these updates and I'll fix them as soon as I can!\n",
