    "body": "This PR aims at:\r\n- allowing, through a variant, the selection of the coroutines implementation to use;\r\n- for some platform a custom implementation is not provided, so it imposes the usage of a generic one;\r\n- default implementation depends on the platform\r\n- in case of generic implementation, add required dependency on `boost+context`;\r\n\r\nMoreover, it fixes a minor cmake configuration problem when `instrumentation=apex` (it was concatenating two cmake variables without any space, due to a missing comma in the list initialization).\r\n\r\nFor reference see https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/issues/4829",
