    "body": "With PR #120 in place, I can now configure Spack to use the system's OpenSSL instead of trying to compile its own.  I did:\n\npackages.yaml:\n\n``````\n    openssl:\n        paths:\n            openssl@system: /usr\n        buildable: False```\n``````\n\nSo far so good.  Now when I install something that uses OpenSSL, I get a spurious warning.  The good news is, everything seems to basically work. But the warning does look ominous (and I'm 99% sure it's totally spurious).\n\n```\n[spack]$ spack install py-scipy ^python@3.5.1 ^netlib-lapack+shared ^netlib-blas+fpic\n==> Warning: This installation depends on an old version of OpenSSL, which may have known security issues. \n==> Warning: Consider updating to the latest version of this package.\n==> Warning: More details at http://www.openssl.org\n```\n",
