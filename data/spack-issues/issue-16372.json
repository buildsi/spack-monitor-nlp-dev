    "body": "Here's an idea I've been experimenting with:\r\n\r\nThis extra code makes several additional passes on the YAML object generated in the Pre-ci process.  These transformations are aimed at reducing the overall size of the generated `.gitlab-ci.yml` file, while still producing an equivalent encoding of the main CI workload.\r\n\r\nThis code is a workaround for the 1MB size limit imposed by Gitlab on projects' `.gitlab-ci.yml` files.  Sites that need a larger `.gitlab-ci.yml` file have to choose between patching the Gitlab source, or disabling the limit entirely, potentially exposing their Gitlab deployment to a class of denial of service attacks.  See [this link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Billion_laughs_attack) and [this link](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-foss/-/issues/56018) for more details.\r\n\r\nThis workaround allows users to run much larger pipelines without having to modify their Gitlab installation.",
