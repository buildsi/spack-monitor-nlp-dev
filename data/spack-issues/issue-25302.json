    "body": "Sorting very large sets of specs (e.g., from a buildcache) can be very slow, so do not sort database results by default. Commands and other consumers of search results should sort their own results instead.\r\n\r\nThis speeds up `spack buildcache list` for https://cache.e4s.io by 2-3x -- from 40s to around 15s for tens of thousands of specs.\r\n\r\nDraft for now because I want to see if this breaks anything, and I need to look at places where we sort specs.",
