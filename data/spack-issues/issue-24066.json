    "body": "Sylabs is the company that was created exclusively to support singularity, and since the project has split I have seen more community initiative and engagement with the sylabs developers and spack, and think that we should be following this org. I understand that this might be political so it could be another idea to take a vote. hpcng is also maintaining Singularity,\r\nbut the primary developers are still in Sylabs and they have other projects so Singularity cannot be their main or only focus.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
