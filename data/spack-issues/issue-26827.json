    "body": "This PR does two things:\r\nUpdate the cray architecture module table with x86-milan -> zen3\r\n\r\nMake cray architecture more robust to future cray systems. In the future, if Spack cannot find the frontend architecture among the cray modules, it will back off and try ancestors of the current architecture. In this case, instead of an error users would have built for `cray-sles15-zen2` instead of `cray-sles15-zen3` between the creation of the system and adding the translation of x86-milan -> zen3 to the cray architecture module table.\r\n\r\nFixes #25914 ",
