    "body": "In the /bin directory, bzip2 creates a bunch of symlinks to the bzip2 executable. For 4 of them (bzegrep, bzfgrep, bzcmp and bzless, it creates absolute symlinks instead of relative ones. Which means that when you create a view, the symlink in the view points to the original location of bzip2 instead of the view version of it. \r\nWould you be open to this patch? \r\nI'm happy to recode this differently if you have suggestion to make it better.",
