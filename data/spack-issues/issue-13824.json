We use a static download cache for fresh spack installations and `ack` was the first package to suddenly fail  to install (after moving from [this commit](https://github.com/electronicvisions/spack/tree/sandbox/breitwieser/upstream_merge_base_7) to [that](https://github.com/electronicvisions/spack/tree/sandbox/breitwieser/upstream_merge_base_8)). I verified that the issue persists in `develop` until [now](https://github.com/spack/spack/commit/9a6a19d464f31d301fb333c5110042f9ead5d501).\r\n\r\nI suspect that is related to the reorganization of the download cache in 4af448724f4f933b5306c4cdd2f7522d64dc8719.",
