You can look around, make experimental\r\nchanges and commit them, and you can discard any commits you make in this\r\nstate without impacting any branches by switching back to a branch.\r\n\r\nIf you want to create a new branch to retain commits you create, you may\r\ndo so (now or later) by using -c with the switch command. Example:\r\n\r\n  git switch -c <new-branch-name>\r\n\r\nOr undo this operation with:\r\n\r\n  git switch -\r\n\r\nTurn off this advice by setting config variable advice.detachedHead to false\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n### After\r\n```console\r\n$ spack fetch py-torch\r\n```",
