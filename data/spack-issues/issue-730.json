    "body": "A lot of work on py-pillow; the original problem was it seemed to be picking up the System's libjpeg (or in my case, no libjpeg because I was building on a minimal system).  Many variants have been now added.  However, this build STILL does not pick up the Spack-supplied libjpeg, and fails if there is none installed on the system.  I'm wondering if it's an upstream problem in the build.\n\nConclusion... this package has been improved, but review / more hacking is needed.  I'm somewhat stuck.\n",
