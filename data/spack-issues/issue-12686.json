Or, at\r\nleast, you can see the paths get written out one by one.\r\n\r\nThis uses an outer read transaction to ensure that actual disk locks are\r\nacquired only once for the whole `spack find` operation, and that each\r\ntransaction inside `spec.prefix` is an in-memory operation. This speeds\r\nup `spack find -p` a lot.",
