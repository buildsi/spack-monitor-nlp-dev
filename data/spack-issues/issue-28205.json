    "body": "Many users are surprised that `spack install python` does not install `pip` (#2065). Some packages actually require a version of Python built with `--ensurepip` (https://github.com/pypa/build/issues/266). This PR adds an `+ensurepip` variant to the Python package. \r\n\r\nI think the only thing we should think about is whether to default to `+ensurepip` or `~ensurepip`. I'm also a bit concerned with how this will interact with #27798. We may need to make the dependency on `py-pip` in `PythonPackage` conditional on the Python variant.\r\n\r\nNote that the `ensurepip` module is available in Python even if `--without-ensurepip` is used. The module seems to work fine, but when you create a venv it doesn't contain `pip`. This causes tools like `build` to fail.\r\n\r\nCloses #2065",
