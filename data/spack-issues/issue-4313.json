    "body": "This is a fairly common issue that I think is worth documenting: See #267, #1909, #2053, #2070, #2546, #2590, #4312, etc.\r\n\r\nI think the change I made to the R package actually prevents this problem? (although the variant resolution mechanism is still broken). But all of the following commands work for me now:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec r\r\n$ spack spec r+X\r\n$ spack spec r~X\r\n```\r\n@hartzell @samfux84 can you test this?\r\n\r\n@tgamblin can you confirm that my diagnosis of the problem is accurate?",
