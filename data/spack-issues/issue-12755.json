    "body": "E501 (line too long) exemptions are probably our most common ones -- we add them for directives, URLs, hashes, etc. in packages.  But we currently add them even when a line *doesn't* need them, which can mask trailing whitespace errors.\r\n\r\nThis changes `spack flake8` so that it will only add E501 exemptions if the line is *actually* too long.",
