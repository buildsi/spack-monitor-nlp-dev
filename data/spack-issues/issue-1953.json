    "body": "In trying to build trilinos with some special compiler options, I noticed that the recipe ignores `cxxflags` set on the spack command line.  In my case, I was trying to build with gcc:\n\n```\n$ spack install trilinos~boost~hdf5~hypre~mumps~suite-sparse ^openmpi@1.10.3 \\\n       cxxflags=\\\"-D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG -D_GLIBCXX_DEBUG_PEDANTIC\\\"\n```\n\nThese extra flags are not applied when building trilinos.  It appears that the recipe ignores this setting.  Can someone confirm this?\n",
