    "body": "Fixed the rocm-dev-libs path when HIP is an external package for newer\r\nversions of HIP.  Fixed rocm-path environment variable to point to the\r\nROCm path rather than the rocm-dev-libs variable.  Added a definition\r\nof the HIP_CLANG_INCLUDE_PATH, which is not properly identified\r\nbecause Spack wraps the compiler up in a Spack specific path, which\r\nprevents proper detection of the Clang compiler headers.",
