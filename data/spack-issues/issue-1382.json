    "body": "WIP: I started trying to build gtkplus@3.20, but this package has many more dependencies than v2 and it requires newer versions of existing packages. This commit provides updates for 5 packages that are required by GTK+3. This is not the complete set of changes required for GTK+3.\n- atk\n  - move default version from 2.14 -> 2.20.\n- glib \n  - move default version from 2.42 -> 2.49\n  - v2.49 requires pcre+utf as a new dependency.\n- pcre \n  - if variant `+utf` is selected, add `'--enable-unicode-properties'` to the configure options.\n- libepoxy\n  - new package to spack\n  - manages OpenGL function pointers.\n- pango\n  - move default version from 1.36 -> 1.40\n",
