    "body": "Is there a way to \"change\" a package underlying a long chain of dependencies, without recompiling the whole chain, e.g. because of a missing small compilation detail?\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nOn a new HPC cluster, I installed some common scientific packages requested, openmpi and on top of it other packages.  \r\nThen I noticed I forgot to build openmpi with support to PBS (and I faced issue #10542).  \r\nThe packages depending on openmpi compiled correctly, since they didn't need that feature, and I've only noticed the missing feature when submitting a test job to a queue.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIs there a (automatic) way to \"substitute\" a package to another? I guess not, because spack builds everything with rpath, so manually changing the hashes in the index file and in `.spack/spec.yaml` packages wouldn't have been sufficient. Adding a symbolic link from the openmpi-dir-without-the-feature to the openmpi-dir-with-the-feature may have solved.\r\n\r\nHave you ever faced this issue? Did you manage to solve it without recompiling the whole chain?\r\n\r\nPS: I've seen #2247 only when I've already done writing this. I don't know whether this is related, and that thread has lots of links, and is now 3 years old.\r\nAre there any news?",
