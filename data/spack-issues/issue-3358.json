    "body": "I want to build a package `a`, which depends on `b`, which depends on `c`, etc. I want to specify the compiler with which `c` is built. This fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack install cosmomc +planck %gcc@6.3.0 ^planck-likelihood +lensing-ext +plik-DS +plik-HM-ext +plik-unbinned ^openmpi ^hwloc ^libpciacess ^pkg-config %clang\r\n==> Error: cosmomc does not depend on hwloc, openmpi, libpciacess, or pkg-config\r\n```\r\nHere `cosmomc` depends on `planck-likelihood`, which depends on `mpi`, so this should work. I'm quite certain it used to work.\r\n\r\nI need to specify the compiler for `pkg-config` because it doesn't build with `gcc` on macOS. On the other hand, `cosmomc` does not build with `clang`.",
