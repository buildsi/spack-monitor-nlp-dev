    "body": "Something weird is going on with Travis. I retriggered #9440 as one unit test timed out when it originally ran, but this time the style check took O(25) minutes. Turns out it spend most of that time performing updates to its system https://travis-ci.org/spack/spack/jobs/437672380\r\n\r\nIs this a known problem and/or do we need to change anything in the Travis setup?",
