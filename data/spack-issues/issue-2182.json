    "body": "Because of the use of \n\n```\n   p.start()\n    exc_type, exception, traceback = parent_connection.recv()\n    p.join()\n    if exception is not None:\n        raise exception\n```\n\nIt is difficult to debug crashes in the package's code. I tried \n\n`./spack --pdb install package`\n\nand it still didn't allowing debugging the inner python code.  \n\nI understand the rational for using subprocesses for packages but is there any way to use the debugger with them? Perhaps when ./spack is run with --pdb the subprocesses are not used?\n",
