    "body": "When we attempt to determine whether a remote spec (in a binary mirror)\r\nis up-to-date or needs to be rebuilt, we compare the full_hash stored in\r\nthe remote spec.yaml file against the full_hash computed from the local\r\nconcrete spec.  Since the full_hash moved into the spec (and is no longer\r\nat the top level of the spec.yaml), we need to look there for it.  This\r\noversight from #18359 was causing all specs to get rebuilt when the\r\nfull_hash wasn't fouhd at the expected location.",
