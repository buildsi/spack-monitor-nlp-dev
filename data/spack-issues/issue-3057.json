    "body": "This branch adds the ability to automatically build and enable environment-modules as part of `spack-env.sh`. The added code detects whether either dotkit or modules is available, and if neither is available, `environment-modules` is built and module function is introduced.\r\n\r\nThis change makes spack more portable as module support is automatically setup.",
