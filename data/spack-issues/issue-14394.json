    "body": "This consolidates some code that was in `cmd/dependencies.py` to `spack.package.possible_dependencies()`, and it adds some tests  Specifically, it's code for dealing with virtuals -- `possible_dependencies()` can just take virtuals now, and does not need special logic in the `spack dependencies` command.  This is an ongoing attempt to get some stuff off `features/solver` and onto the mainline.\r\n\r\n- [x] fix a bug where possible_dependencies wasn't properly returning virtuals\r\n- [x] move some logic for handling virtual packages from the `spack dependencies` command into `spack.package.possible_dependencies()`\r\n- [x] rework possible dependencies tests so that expected and actual output are on the left/right respectively (I can't wrap my brain around `pytest` diff output where subtractions are from actual and additions are to expected -- \ud83e\udd2f)",
