    "body": "#7574 removed the `mpirun`/`mpiexec` executable when OpenMPI is built with slurm support. I suggest restoring them for a few reasons:\r\n\r\n1.  Calling `mpirun` after `salloc`/`sbatch` is a documented practice on OpenMPI website. See https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=slurm. People might follow the instruction and get surprised -- either not find `mpirun` , or an incorrect version like `/usr/bin/mpirun` is called. Indeed this is how I find this issue.\r\n2. Directly using `mpirun` is useful for fine-tuning the MCA parameter, e.g. force TCP and turn off IB & Vader by `mpirun --mca btl tcp,self`. Useful for debugging sometimes :) . With`srun` it can still be done by setting `OMPI_MCA_<param_name>`, but a bit inconvenient (https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=tuning#setting-mca-params). Using `orterun` feels exotic for most users.\r\n3. In certain cases `mpirun` can have better performance than `srun` (though probably rare with `srun --mpi=pmix`). See https://www.mail-archive.com/users@lists.open-mpi.org/msg31874.html\r\n\r\nJust a small suggestion :)  In any case, I really appreciate #7574 (and #8427) -- OpenMPI + slurm works quite well so far!",
