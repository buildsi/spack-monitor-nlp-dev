    "body": "This PR adds a feature were all CrayPE targets that are available on a Cray are added to the `Platform.targets` list by default. This way, users can do builds targetting the front-end without explicitly setting a config file for the front end target as long as they know the correct architecture.\n\nThe Cray platform initialization now also requires modulecmd to be found in the PATH. This lets Spack fail with a useful error message if `modulecmd` is not in the PATH, whereas before it would just hang.\n",
