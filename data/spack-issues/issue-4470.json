    "body": "This PR starts from a complaint from one of our users about `hdf5` compiler wrappers, that were still configured to use Spack wrappers. As I saw the code to filter those files repeated over and over in different packages I tried to factorize it in one place. Mixins seem a good enough approach to factor out common behavior that appears across different build systems.",
