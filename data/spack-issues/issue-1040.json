    "body": "I have been unable to build Boost with some toolset/platform combinations. The users I support don't need the Boost features in Trilinos, so I have been manually hacking trilinos/package.py to disable boost. I would like to propose that these changes be added to the released version.\n- Add boost as a variant, default to true so there is no change to existing behavior.\n- Move the CMake configure options related to Boost into a conditional block that is triggered by `if '+boost' in spec`.\n- Fix formatting to meet code style guidelines.\n",
