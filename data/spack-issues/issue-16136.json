    "body": "These conflicts were added by @glennpj in #14619, but I don't see where they come from. In #15548, @darthsuogles mentioned that the official Docker image still builds with old versions of CUDA. I've also personally built PyTorch 1.4.0 with CUDA 9 and `cuda_arch=35`, so I think these conflicts are incorrect. @glennpj if you can chime in with where these conflicts came from, that would be great. Note that I modified the conflicts slightly in #15548, so maybe I got something wrong during the conversion.",
