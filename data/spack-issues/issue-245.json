    "body": "@tgamblin would it be beneficial to have an option to launch spack under the pdb debugger in a similar manner to what exists for profiling? I can easily implement this myself, but if you think it is worthwhile, then I was hoping to get an opinion on what the command-line arg should be since -d, --debug is already taken. I was thinking -D, --pdb, but am open to other suggestions.\n",
