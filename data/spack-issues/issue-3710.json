    "body": "We've had a `MakefilePackage` for a while now that offers several improvements over the generic `Package` superclass. However, no one seems to be using it. I think the problem is that `spack create` doesn't choose it, so I fixed that. Now, if no other build system is found, but a `GNUmakefile`, `makefile`, or `Makefile` file exists, we will choose `MakefilePackage`.\r\n\r\nAlso fixed a minor bug where we don't rename packages like `voro++` until after we check to see whether or not they are a valid name.",
