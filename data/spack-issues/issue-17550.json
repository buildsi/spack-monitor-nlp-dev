    "body": "spack info kallisto \r\nreports that kallisto depends on mpich.\r\n\r\nThis is surprising to me because it is not optional and specific to the mpich package (and not a dependency on the virtual MPI package).  But even more surprising, is I do not see any mention of kallisto supporting MPI.  I cannot find any mention of MPI in the source code, and the only MPI dependency appears to be indirect via hdf5 built with MPI support (see e.g. \r\nhttps://github.com/pachterlab/kallisto/issues/91)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2.

They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt]()\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt]()\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures.
