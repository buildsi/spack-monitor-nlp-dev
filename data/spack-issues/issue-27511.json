    "body": "There are currently issues with using spack with spack monitor that this PR will address. I'm opening it in case people are interested to use spack monitor, it's important these things are fixed. Bugs are detailed in the next paragraph.\r\n\r\nUpdates to installer.py did not account for spack monitor, so as currently implemented there are three cases of failure that spack monitor will not account for. To fix this we add additional hooks, including an on cancel. Spack monitor also could not see a concretization fail, so I've added that too. This is from my branch of spack that I've been using with builds.spack.io. I also added an ability to customize the spack environment  on the fly for better control (e.g., on github actions I don't really want to know the hostname of the runners, I just want to know it's on github-actions.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
