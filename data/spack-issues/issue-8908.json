    "body": "\r\nSummary\r\n\r\nWhen subclassing a package, the resources such as  patches do not get propagated in the right way...\r\n\r\nE.g. If I had a package like this...\r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom spack import *\r\nfrom spack.pkg.builtin.kaldi import Kaldi as KaldiSpack\r\n\r\nclass Kaldi(KaldiSpack):\r\n    version('master', git='https://github.com/kaldi-asr/kaldi.git')\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe path to \"openfst-1.4.1.patch\" is incorrect, a full path would need to be provided to the patch for it to work. Currently if I want to extend an existing package I would need to copy all the resources to the extended package as well.\r\n\r\nThe above is pretty easy to reproduce reliably, just pick any package that has a patch or additional resource files and extend it.",
