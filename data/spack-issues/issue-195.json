    "body": "Spack's `cc` compiler and linker wrapper changes the order in which arguments are passed to the linker. Specifically, library paths are moved in front of libraries. This creates problems if a library can be found in multiple locations, and the reordering makes them found in the wrong locations.\n\nThis is specifically a problem when building LLVM on a system that has LLVM installed in a system library. The command line passed to Spack's `cc` looks something like\n\n```\n-lLLVM-3.3 -L/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu\n```\n\nand both the build directory of LLVM as well as the system directory `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu` contain a file `libLLVM-3.3.so`.\n\nI have modified `cc` to keep the original arguments; a not-so-elegant sample implementation is at https://gist.github.com/eschnett/f4459534f3b797235aa4.\n\nWith these changes, I can build LLVM 3.3 just fine.\n",
