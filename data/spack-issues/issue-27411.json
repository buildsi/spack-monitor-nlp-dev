    "body": "This PR puts in place a stand-alone test for AMReX. It is only compatible with the development branch at this point, however it will be supported on future releases of AMReX. I also had to implement the CMake workaround to ensure the same version that was used to install AMReX is used to compile the stand-alone test. \r\n\r\nI have several concerns regarding skipping tests for past AMReX versions and would appreciate feedback on how to address them. They are:\r\n1. On line 276: I'm just using print to explain that the test has been skipped. Should I be sending a warning or doing something else instead?\r\n2. In general, our test is not compatible with older versions and thus is skipped. However, when I run `spack test run amrex` the status is a reported as \"PASSED\". Is there a way to report a different status, such as \"SKIPPED\", etc. ?  \r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\nErik",
