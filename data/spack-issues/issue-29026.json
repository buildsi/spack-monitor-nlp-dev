    "body": "Fixes #28840 \r\n\r\nThis PR adds support in environments for external configuration files obtained from a URL.\r\n\r\nSpack currently assumes these files reside on the local file system but projects and facilities put a lot of effort into defining standard, or base, configuration files for their systems. Spack should make it easier to use configuration files from the web.  \r\n\r\nSome have system-specific configurations, more inclusive environment files, or both.  Examples can be found at:\r\n- https://github.com/LLNL/radiuss-spack-configs\r\n- https://github.com/spack/spack-configs\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Find alternative to `requests` module (e.g., ~curl and or~ preferred fetcher)\r\n- [ ] Resolve recursion issues with `test_env_include_packages_url`\r\n- [ ] Add `test_config_include_url`\r\n- [ ] Cache fetch configuration files locally (i.e., an environment stage directory)\r\n- [ ] Replace URL-based tests with a separate repo (per Todd)",
