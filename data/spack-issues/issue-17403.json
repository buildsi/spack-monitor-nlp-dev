    "body": "As a maintainer I want to remove the explicit enumeration of Spack versions in:\r\n\r\n- https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/lib/spack/spack/container/images.json\r\n- https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/lib/spack/spack/schema/container.py\r\n\r\nso that there will be one place less to update when cutting a new release. \r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nRecently the release process has been documented, with TODO for improvement on the overall process:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/blob/9ec9327f5aacc7b62a1469771c8917547393676d/lib/spack/docs/developer_guide.rst#L621-L626\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA proper solution might need some discussion and might involve:\r\n\r\n- Computing the versions that are currently in `images.json` dynamically (by querying Dockerhub?)\r\n- Move the check on the YAML file from the schema to a later dynamic check.\r\n\r\nThis section will be updated as the discussion on this issue progresses.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.15.0-62-d65a076c0\r\n```\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first.
