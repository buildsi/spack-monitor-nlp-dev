    "body": "Fixes #6905\r\n\r\nExternal packages can have unspecified properties, in particular all children of external packages are stripped.\r\n\r\nThis updates the conflict-checking logic to require that the conflict spec matches exactly and that all fields mentioned in the conflict spec are present in the concretized spec in order to report a conflict. This will automatically skip all conflict checks for dependencies of externals.",
