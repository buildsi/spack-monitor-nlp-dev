Note that I am a new spack user and therefore something much simpler may be available. Anyway, I thought of posting the solution either way.\r\n\r\nI was able to find different websites hosting libxc. However, cp2k requires libxc version 4.0.3 or newer. I was only able to find it here:\r\n`git clone https://github.com/dgasmith/libxc.git`\r\n\r\nIssue is spack needs a url with the actual tarball to download it using wget. Therefore, here are the steps to follow:\r\n\r\n- Download an older version of libxc: `wget http://www.sunqm.net/pyscf/files/src/libxc-3.0.1.tar.gz`\r\n\r\n- Obtain its sha256: `sha256sum libxc-3.0.1.tar.gz`\r\n\r\n- Go into `$YOUR_SPACK_DIR/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/libxc/package.py` and replace the homepage, url variables as well as the version number - choose 4.0.3 - and its sha256 sum so that it downloads from the link above. Also replace the website in the \"if\" statements\r\n\r\n- Run spack install cp2k ==> It will install libxc correctly then other packages. Once it gets to building cp2k, you will get an error saying cp2k requires libxc 4.0.3 or sooner\r\n\r\n- Download the newer libxc (doesn't matter where): `git clone https://github.com/dgasmith/libxc.git`\r\n\r\n- Install `autoreconf -i && ./configure --prefix=$HOME/tmp && make && make install`\r\n\r\n- Find where spack installed the libxc libraries and delete everything: (dir will be something like this `$YOUR_SPACK_DIR/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-9.2.0/libxc-4.0.3-linbltlqag7mrzgh57avdqd37tvftbmg/{bin,lib,include}`)\r\n\r\n- Replace those directories with the freshly installed one from git: `cp -r $HOME/tmp/* $YOUR_SPACK_DIR/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-9.2.0/libxc-4.0.3-linbltlqag7mrzgh57avdqd37tvftbmg/`\r\n\r\n- `spack install cp2k` will work :)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
