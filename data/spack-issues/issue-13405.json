    "body": "Currently, `spack deprecate` runs the post-install hooks that delete modulefiles. The rational is that we don't want users using deprecated specs\r\n\r\nHowever, the rationale for the `spack deprecate` command is to allow hard-coded binaries depending on the deprecated package to work properly without using the deprecated package. There is a similar goal to achieve w.r.t deprecated modules. Dependent modules may be configured to autoload their dependencies, and will fail without the module for the deprecated package.\r\n\r\nProposal: We change the `post_uninstall` hook for modulefile generation to delete the module file IF the package is uninstalled, and to delete the modulefile and replace it with a symlink if the package is deprecated.\r\n\r\nInspired by @scheibelp's comment at https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/12933#discussion_r337736150",
