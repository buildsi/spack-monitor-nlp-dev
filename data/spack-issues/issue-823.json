    "body": "I'm trying to write a package for the [STREAM benchmark](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/). Frustratingly, the [source code](https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/FTP/Code/) isn't packaged in a tar, nor is it numbered with any versions. I found a slightly older tar packaged by [NERSC](http://www.nersc.gov/users/computational-systems/cori/nersc-8-procurement/trinity-nersc-8-rfp/nersc-8-trinity-benchmarks/stream/), so I can use that if I have to and just give it a fake number. I'm just wondering if there's a better way to go about this that I haven't thought of yet. Can Spack download a ftp directory like STREAM uses?\n",
