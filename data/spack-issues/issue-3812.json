    "body": "Fixes #327 \r\nFixes #3010 \r\nFixes https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spack/viVmaAUQCj4\r\n\r\nBy popular demand, you can now set the default level of parallelism in your `~/.spack/config.yaml` settings! By default, Spack runs all builds in parallel, using the number of available cores as the number of jobs to pass to make. With a `config.yaml` of:\r\n```yaml\r\nconfig:\r\n  jobs: 4\r\n```\r\nSpack will use `make -j4` instead of hogging every core. This can still be overridden on the command line with:\r\n```\r\n$ spack install -j8 zlib\r\n```\r\nIf you want to forego parallel builds altogether, you can use:\r\n```yaml\r\nconfig:\r\n  parallel: false\r\n```\r\n\r\n@eschnett @HenrikBengtsson ",
