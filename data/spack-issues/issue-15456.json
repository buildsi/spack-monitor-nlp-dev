    "body": "This is a set of smoke tests for the `openmpi` package.  \r\n\r\nThis PR leverages the `_run_test` function introduced in #15092 to perform version checks, check expected result status, and check expected output.  This PR introduces the notion of running a complete set of checks before terminating (versus terminating on the first failure).\r\n\r\nFollow-on work will introduce simple executable programs for the major languages -- C, C++, and Fortran -- that must be compiled and run.  Tests to check the rpath _may_ be introduced.  According to John Gyllenhaal (LLNL), these types of tests -- if they were run on multiple nodes with multiple tasks -- could catch 95% of the problems with an installation.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Determine if the version checks are too fragile wrt different versions of openmpi\r\n        (There are differences e.g., eight of the version tests fail for v2.0.0.  Supporting these differences is dependent on the integration of #15979 (or equivalent).)\r\n~- [ ] Add simple test that is compiled and run for C*~\r\n~- [ ] Add simple test that is compiled and run for C++*~\r\n~- [ ] Add simple test that is compiled and run for FORTRAN/F90*~\r\n\r\n*These should be designed and implemented with an eye toward sharing them across MPI providers.",
