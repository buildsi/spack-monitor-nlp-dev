    "body": "This change narrows the scope of the try/except block used for checking if a package implements build- or install-time tests, to avoid a misleading error message if the test function throws an AttributeError.\r\n\r\nThe original error message told me that the check method wasn't implemented, but the problem was actually that I had an error within my check method. As someone new to spack (and thus who makes lots of mistakes) this was confusing, as it was the same error message that I had been seeing before I found the correct name for the test method.\r\n\r\nI hope this change is useful. There were a few failures in the style and unit tests, but those appear to have also existed on the develop branch.",
