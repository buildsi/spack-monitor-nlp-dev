    "body": "Hello all, I'm still redoing our cluster (troubleshooting RoCE without previous experience is so much fun...) and I'd like to install some environments; the spack.yaml looks something like\r\n```\r\nspack:\r\n  specs:\r\n  - sne.openmpi@4.1.1+pmi+legacylaunchers+thread_multiple schedulers=slurm fabrics=ucx\r\n  - sne.ucx@1.11-dev-210427+thread_multiple+rc+dc+ud+mlx5-dv\r\n  - hdf5@1.10.7+hl+cxx+fortran+threadsafe+mpi%gcc@8.4.0\r\n...\r\n  view: true\r\n  concretization: together\r\n```\r\nNow, my problem is that the concretization is not picking up the `sne`-namespace-specs, but instead defaulting to the ones from the namespace-repo (as visible in the generated spack.lock). The namespace is working as intended, I've already installed the specs!\r\n\r\nIs this supposed to work that way, am I doing something wrong or is this in reality a bug?\r\n\r\nEDIT: System info:\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2332-febeca2b05\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.3\r\n* **Platform:** linux-debian10-skylake_avx512\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n",
