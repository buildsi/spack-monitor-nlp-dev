    "body": "### Summary\n\nPlease add a command line option printing all bootstrap dependencies (e.g., `spack bootstrap dependencies`) in such a way that it can be passed to `spack mirror create` on a machine with a different operating system and/or different instruction set architecture.\n\n### Rationale\n\nOn air-gapped systems or systems with restricted internet access, bootstrapping is easily possible if the build cache contains all needed source packages. This could easily be achieved with `spack mirror create` and widely-used tools like scp or rsync if there was just a way to get a list of bootstrapping dependencies.\n\n### Description\n\n* A custom buildcache does _not_ resolve the bootstrapping problem on air-gapped systems without cooperating admins.\r\n* Building on another host and copying the bootstrapped cling does not work if there are operating system, instruction set architecture, or spack version differences.\n\n### Additional information\n\nThe C++14 dependency of the bootstrap process is not a problem because the air-gapped systems accessible to the author have modules with more recent compiler versions (GCC 4.8.5 on RHEL 7 does not support C++14).\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
