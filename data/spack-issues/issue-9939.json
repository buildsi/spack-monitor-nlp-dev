    "body": "Lets say we have intel-mkl as external package in packages.yaml: \r\n\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n  intel-mkl:\r\n    paths:\r\n      intel-mkl@2018.1.163 threads=none ~ilp64+shared: /some/path\r\n```\r\n\r\nWe expect this to match with `threads=none` only. But we see:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack install intel-mkl@2018.1.163 threads=none ~ilp64+shared\r\n==> intel-mkl@2018.1.163 : externally installed in /some/path\r\n==> intel-mkl@2018.1.163 : generating module file\r\n==> intel-mkl@2018.1.163 : registering into DB\r\n\r\n$ spack install intel-mkl@2018.1.163 threads=openmp ~ilp64+shared\r\n==> intel-mkl@2018.1.163 : externally installed in /some/path   => WRONG, shouldn't match with threads=openmp\r\n==> intel-mkl@2018.1.163 : already registered in DB\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs the second spec asks for `threads=openmp`, we expect to have separate installation.",
