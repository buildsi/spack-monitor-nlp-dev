    "body": "https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/hg/sip/file/6.4.0\r\n\r\nNewer versions are available on pypi and the build system was changed to use setuptools. In addition the module variant was removed. I think the modules where outsourced into individual packages, e.g. PyQt5.sip into [pyqt5-sip](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5-sip/) but I made sure that the old packages incl. modules still work.\r\n\r\nTested installation (including `--test=root`) for versions 4.19.21, 5.5.0, 6.4.0\r\nAlso tested that `py-pyqt5` which depends on `py-sip module=PyQt5.sip` still builds correctly (concretizes to use `py-sip@4.19.21` as before)",
