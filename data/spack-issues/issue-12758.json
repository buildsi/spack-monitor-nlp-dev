    "body": "fixes #12800 \r\n\r\nWarnings in `detect_scheduler()` print out whenever the package is loaded, which  means you can see them in Spack commands that load all packages but have nothing to do with UPC++ (e.g., `spack clean -a`,  `spack dependents`, and others).\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove these and other warnings, since the scheduler is visible in the package variant anyway.\r\n\r\n- [x] Also remove the `user` scheduler option from `upcxx`, as it depends on the user's environment in a way that is not likely to be the same across systems.\r\n\r\n@bonachea, @mjacquel can you take a look at this one?  The main thing I need feedback on is what the user setting for `CROSS` can be.  Is it needed?  Can it be something other than SLURM or ALPS?  If not we should remove it.  If so, then it should be changed to be a string-valued variant, so the user can set its value in a way Spack will actually understand.   Basically we're trying to avoid environment-dependent things in Spack --  one hash should map to one build.\r\n\r\nJust for my own edification, does the UPC++  build link to different libraries depending on what CROSS is set to?  Does it actually affect the final binary somehow, or is that just a build-time thing?",
