    "body": "This adds support in spack for both build/install tests (spack install\r\n--run-tests) and post-install smoke tests (spack test run).\r\n\r\nHpctoolkit itself only recently added tests, so for now, this only\r\napplies to branch master.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThe hpctoolkit package only has a tests directory in branch master\r\n(for now).  It would be cleaner to write:\r\n\r\n```\r\n@when('@master')\r\n@run_after('install')\r\ndef copy_test_files(self):\r\n    self.cache_extra_test_sources(['tests'])\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut that currently doesn't work, see issue #27771.\r\n",
