    "body": "This is an attempt to fix \"Missing base commit\" messages in the codecov UI. Because we do not run full tests on package PRs, package PRs' merge commits on `develop` don't have coverage info. It appears that codecov will give you an error if the pseudo-base's coverage data doesn't all apply properly to the real PR base, unless the `allow_coverage_offsets` option is set. \r\n\r\n* See here for docs:\r\n  https://docs.codecov.com/docs/comparing-commits#pseudo-comparison\r\n\r\n* See here for another potential solution:\r\n  https://community.codecov.com/t/2480/15",
