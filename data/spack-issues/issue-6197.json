    "body": "I installed spack on my home directory which is on a NFS. The NFS is shared by several HPC clusters. When I install packages on a cluster, it turns out it can be used by another cluster which has different OS version, eg, CentOS6 vs. CentOS7 in my case.\r\n\r\nI have no clues how to deal with it. Can someone give me a hint or point me to the documentation?\r\n\r\nBy the way, the error messages are:\r\n> ==> Error: No compilers found for operating system centos6 and target x86_64.\r\n> If previous installations have succeeded, the operating system may have been updated.\r\n> Compilers are defined for the following operating systems and targets:\r\n>         centos7-x86_64",
