    "body": "The elk version in the package builtin repo is very old (3.* while 7.* is released) and fails to link against external libxc, at least in my setup\r\n\r\nI tried to update the elk/package.py for handling the latest version of elk, but failed. The issue is that elk slightly changed the way it links against external blas/lapack and requires to compile stubs for missing MKL/OpenBLAS\r\n\r\nIn addition handling of libxc in elk changed, I had to set             \r\n            config['SRC_libxc'] = ' '.join([\r\n                'libxcf90.f90',\r\n                'libxcifc.f90'\r\n            ])\r\nafter which this particular part apparently works fine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
