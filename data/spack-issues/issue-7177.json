    "body": "Package description covers the gist of what this package installs.\r\n\r\nIf everything makes sense to reviewers, I can squash it to a single commit, but I wanted to expose the whole history to illustrate how picky the build system is, and that certain qualities of good spack package style won't work here (e.g., normally, explicit slashes in paths aren't preferred, but BSD-like path constructions in the makefile require them). I've attempted to clean up the package as much as I can despite the build system's rough edges (it's really not meant for public consumption).\r\n\r\nThis PR takes care of the first, and probably most difficult, part of #7172.",
