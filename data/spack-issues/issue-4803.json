Looking at the spack-build.out it looks for mpi wrappers in /blues/gpfs/home/software/spack-0.10.1/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/intel-17.0.4/intel-mpi-2017.3-dfphq6kavje2olnichisvjjndtridrok/bin and it cant find them there. They are in  /blues/gpfs/home/software/spack-0.10.1/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/intel-17.0.4/intel-mpi-2017.3-dfphq6kavje2olnichisvjjndtridrok/compilers_and_libraries_2017.4.196/linux/mpi/intel64/bin.
