    "body": "Adds the latest version of GSL, HDF, and NCO.\n\nResolves a variant resolution bug described in #1553. Without this bug fix, I ran into this problem:\n\n```\n$ spack graph nco\n==> Error: Invalid spec: 'netcdf@4.4.1%gcc@6.1.1+hdf4~mpi arch=linux-fedora24-x86_64'. Package netcdf requires variant +mpi, but spec asked for ~mpi\n```\n\nThis is because my `packages.yaml` says to build `netcdf~mpi`, but doesn't properly override `nco` which defaults to `+mpi`.\n",
