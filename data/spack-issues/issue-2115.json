This could be part of the Spack and/or EasyBuild documentation, or it could be hosted separately on 'neutral' ground (while making it clear the comparison is endorsed by both communities).\n> \n> Anyone up for helping out with that?\n> Elisabeth: maybe you're interested, since you've been involved with both projects up close?\n> \n> regards,\n> Kenneth\n> \n> @tgamblin \n",
