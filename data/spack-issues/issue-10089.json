    "body": "Hey folks,\r\n\r\nI'm looking to update the Caliper package, specifically to add a `static` or `shared` variant. I've seen this is a mildly discussion-provoking topic in issues like #5269 , and that the documentation currently says that if you do this with variants, [to name them `static` or `shared`](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#variant-names) and default your variant to true.  \r\n\r\nIs there a canonical way to do this? Do most packages prefer to name it `shared`, or do people lean towards `static`? What would be best style/practice, or is this one of those places where each package picks its own logic?",
