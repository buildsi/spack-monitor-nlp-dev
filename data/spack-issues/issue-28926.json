    "body": "Follow-on to #28797 . \r\n\r\nOlder versions of GCC (8.3 and probably others) directly propagate `MACOSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` to `ld` rather than padding with `.0.0` like newer ones. This leads to a failure:\r\n```console\r\n$ ld -macosx_version_min 11\r\nld: -macos_version_min value malformed: '11'\r\n```\r\nwhereas `ld -macosx_version_min 11.0 ...` works.\r\n\r\nSo this commit tests for the macOS version having only a single component and adds `.0` if that's the case. This choice is consistent with what CMake does and ensures that libraries on the same major OS are all compatible.",
