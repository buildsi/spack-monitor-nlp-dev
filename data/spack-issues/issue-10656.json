    "body": "`spack --debug` is invaluable for getting stack traces when things go wrong.  However, it also produces a lot of extra debugging printout that might not even be relevant anymore.  Stuff like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> READ LOCK: /gpfsm/dnb53/rpfische/spack7/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[4996285069150612422:1] [Released]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /gpfsm/dnb53/rpfische/spack7/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[3796603063533368696:1] [Acquiring]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /gpfsm/dnb53/rpfische/spack7/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[3796603063533368696:1] [Acquired]\r\n==> WRITE LOCK: /gpfsm/dnb53/rpfische/spack7/opt/spack/.spack-db/prefix_lock[3796603063533368696:1] [Released]\r\n```\r\nWould it be possible to either:\r\n 1. Clean up the output produced by `spack --debug`\r\n 2. Add a different command-line flag or configuration that causes Spack to produce stacktraces without accompanying debug output?\r\n\r\n",
