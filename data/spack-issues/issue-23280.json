    "body": "Make Ginkgo use ROCmPackage and improve tests.\r\n\r\n+ We add proper smoke tests support for Ginkgo develop and future versions. We are creating specific executables in `test_install` for our backends (reference, CUDA, HIP) and check kernel/solver results with a test matrix.\r\n+ The Ginkgo package dependencies have been updated, and some more control added, e.g. for enabling HWLOC\r\n+ Ginkgo now uses ROCmPackage instead of adding a `hip` variant for better uniformity with the other packages.\r\n\r\nNote that there is a few issues with some HIP packages which we rely on and without these fixes, the packages cannot be used properly. I fixed the issues separately in two commits, but maybe the HIP maintainers will not like these.\r\n\r\nCC @tldahlgren ",
