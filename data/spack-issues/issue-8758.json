To give more information on the failure, I first tried to separetely install all packages on which OpenFOAM builds. All packages install well, except for parmgridgen. \r\n\r\nI therefore downloaded parmgridgen from the URL http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~moulitsa/software . I learned that the installation will go well provided the include paths are properly set as above. I am now trying to repeat this exercise using spack. \r\n",
