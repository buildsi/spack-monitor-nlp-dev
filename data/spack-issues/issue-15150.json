    "body": "It would be nice if spack had a tool to update the available versions of a tool based on the content/availability of versions on a website.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nSpack package software versions are often out of date.  If I notice a package that is missing newer versions of software, it'd be nice if I could just run a quick tool to fix it so I can get on with my day.  The tool could also suggest next steps I can copy-paste to make a quick pull request.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nDebian has https://manpages.debian.org/buster/devscripts/uscan.1.en.html that performs this-- if you're a package maintainer, you just need to run uscan <package_name> and it will update the package for you.  If the package requires no changes other than updating the version, the uscan/uwatch tools just work.\r\n\r\nI'd like something like uwatch/uscan in the debian packaging scripts, which makes this process painless and easy. The tool doesn't have to be bulletproof, just:\r\n- Examining available versions in a git repo\r\n- Examining available versions in a webpage of tarballs\r\n- Examining available versions in common places, like pypi\r\n- Update the package to add a new version.\r\n\r\nIf the tool messes up the package, that's on me as a maintainer to fix.  The tool would just automate the rote drugery of adding new versions to packages.  Perhaps the tool could even give me Markdown text on the command line that I can use to paste into a pull request.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n",
