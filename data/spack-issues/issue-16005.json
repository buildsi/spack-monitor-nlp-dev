    "body": "This PR adds new variants to the Tau package. Unfortunately, as best I could tell, Tau has no way to explicitly disable a config option, only enable it explicitly. Because of this this PR contains no logic for explicitly disabling these new config options. \r\n\r\nNew variants are added for enabling profiling, profile parameters, profile callpaths, tau to slog2 conversion, and the cputime option.",
