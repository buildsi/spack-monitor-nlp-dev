I added `depends_on('blas')` and `depends_on('lapack')`, although that change in and of itself does not fix the build (env['BLAS'], etc. were previously being set properly even without the `depends_on()` statments).\n\nIt's curious that `py-numpy` builds just fine but `py-scipy` seems to need the symlinks to `libblas.so` and `liblapack.so`.  :shrug:\n",
