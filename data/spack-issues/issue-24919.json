    "body": "I have the problem that package A is calling a nested make on package B. The Makefile for B, generated by Cmake, contains\r\n```\r\n# Produce verbose output by default.\r\nVERBOSE = 1\r\n\r\n# Command-line flag to silence nested $(MAKE).\r\n$(VERBOSE)MAKESILENT = -s\r\n \r\n# Suppress display of executed commands.\r\n$(VERBOSE).SILENT:\r\n```\r\nwhich means that I cannot see the invocation details of the nested make.\r\n\r\nIs there a way to include the invocation details and output from the nested make?",
