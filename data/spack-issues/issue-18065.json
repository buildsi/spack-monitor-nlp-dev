    "body": "I found that the `libmount` variant I added in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/15631 is totally a wrong way to link `libintl`.\r\nI added this variant just because `nfs-utils` will link to `libblkid`, and some API in `libblkid` called another API in `libintl`.\r\n\r\nI want to fix this error by removing `libintl` link in `util-linux`, then add the `LIBS` or `LDFLAGS` in `nfs-utils` package.",
