    "body": "This PR converts the `gtkplus` package to use the new Meson build system. It is loosely based on [Homebrew's gtk+3](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/gtk%2B3.rb) recipe. Older versions that don't support Meson have been deprecated.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I haven't managed to get this to build on macOS. I also wasn't able to get the previous version to build either. Help wanted \ud83d\ude04 \r\n\r\nThis package has seen a lot of churn and could really use an official maintainer. According to `spack blame`, @aweits @michaelkuhn @Sinan81 @lee218llnl @mjwoods have modified this package in the past.",
