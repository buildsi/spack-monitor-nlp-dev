    "body": "I have installed xSDK with Spack and I want to grab all the involved packages and put them in one place that is easy to refer to.  I am currently using Spack's \"view symlink\" capability to do this.  However, it fails every time with the following message...\r\n\r\n...\r\n==> Warning: Skipping existing file: /home/aperry/local/amanzi/tpls/lib64/valgrind/arm-with-vfpv3.xml\r\n==> Warning: Skipping existing file: /home/aperry/local/amanzi/tpls/lib64/valgrind/mips-linux-valgrind.xml\r\n==> Warning: Skipping existing file: /home/aperry/local/amanzi/tpls/lib64/valgrind/power-vsx-valgrind-s2.xml\r\n==> Warning: Skipping existing file: /home/aperry/local/amanzi/tpls/lib64/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so\r\n==> Warning: Skipping existing file: /home/aperry/local/amanzi/tpls/lib64/valgrind/s390x-core64-valgrind-s2.xml\r\n==> Error: [Errno 17] File exists\r\n\r\nObviously, there are many more warnings than that, but it's the error that is troubling.  It is my understanding that xSDK is about having a cohesive set of software that all play well together.  How then is it an error to try and install them all in the same place?  Warning about copying existing files is one thing, but throwing an error is a different thing all together.",
