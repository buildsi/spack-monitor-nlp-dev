    "body": "`spack create` and `spack checksum` should save the tarballs they download to the downloads cache like `spack fetch` and `spack install` do.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nI frequently run `spack checksum` to add new versions of a package. After that, I then run `spack patch` to make sure the patches are still valid, or `spack install` to actually install the package. This causes Spack to download the tarballs twice. We only need to download things once.",
