    "body": "not ready for merge quite yet\r\n\r\nIt installs, but the MPI variant (which is on by default) does not work for me, I'm not sure yet if this is due to something in my environment or something changed in the 1.0.0 package. I don't think I got the older version to install with mpi successfully either.\r\n\r\nAlso, I'm open to suggestions on a better way to handle the Pkg import that's required on 1.0.0. My solution feels clunky.\r\n\r\nWill do some more testing & post back if/when ready for merge.",
