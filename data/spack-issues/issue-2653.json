    "body": "Lets suppose I have an infiniband cluster. I would like to have communication libraries to build with the +verbs variant when it is available. I tried to express this in package.yaml:\r\n\r\n``` yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  all:\r\n    compiler: [gcc, intel, pgi, clang, xl, nag]\r\n    variants: +verbs\r\n    providers:\r\n      mpi: [openmpi, mpich]\r\n      blas: [openblas]\r\n      lapack: [openblas]\r\n      pil: [py-pillow]\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it neither throws an error, nor influences spec concretization. \r\n\r\n``` bash\r\n# spack spec mpich\r\nmpich@3.2%gcc@4.8.5+hydra+pmi+romio~verbs\r\n```",
