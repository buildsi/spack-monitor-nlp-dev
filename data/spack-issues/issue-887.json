    "body": "In #810, I removed OpenMPI's dependency on hwloc because it can be built with an internal hwloc that comes with it. As it turns out, the hwloc that comes with OpenMPI is a bit behind the latest version of hwloc, so it is better to build it with an external package. Thanks for pointing this out @eschnett \n",
