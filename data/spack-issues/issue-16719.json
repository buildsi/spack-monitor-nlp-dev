    "body": "This PR ~is mainly for the discussion in #16671 and~ is an extension of #15950.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of merging this is that we can install all valid configurations of `netcdf-c`:\r\n1. It is possible to build `netcdf-c` without parallel I/O even when `hdf5` is built with `+mpi`:\r\n    ```console\r\n    $ spack install netcdf-c~mpi ^hdf5+mpi\r\n    ```\r\n    but not for versions before `4.4.0` as it should be:\r\n    ```console\r\n    $ spack install netcdf-c@4.3.3.1~mpi ^hdf5+mpi\r\n    ==> Error: An unsatisfiable variant constraint has been detected for spec:\r\n    \r\n    hdf5+mpi\r\n    \r\n    \r\n    while trying to concretize the partial spec:\r\n    \r\n        netcdf-c@4.3.3.1~mpi\r\n            ^zlib@1.2.5:\r\n    ```\r\n\r\n2. It is possible to build `netcdf-fortran` when `netcdf-c` is built without NetCDF4 parallel features (i.e. `~mpi`) but with parallel features for NetCDF3 (i.e. `+parallel-netcdf`):\r\n    ```console\r\n    $ spack install netcdf-fortran ^netcdf-c~mpi+parallel-netcdf\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThe main disadvantage of this is that in order to build `netcdf-c` without MPI dependencies at all, one has to run:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack spec -I netcdf-fortran ^netcdf-c~mpi ^hdf5~mpi`\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut this can be handled in `packages.yaml`:\r\n```yaml\r\n  netcdf-c:\r\n    variants: ~mpi\r\n  hdf5:\r\n    variants: ~mpi\r\n```\r\n\r\nWith this configuration, one can install `netcdf-fortran` without MPI dependencies by calling:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install netcdf-fortran\r\n```\r\nand enable MPI by calling:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install netcdf-fortran ^netcdf-c+mpi\r\n```",
