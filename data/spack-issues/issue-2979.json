    "body": "Many have pointed out that it would be nice if Spack used system-install packages for many things, rather than building its own.    Examples include bison, flex, gettext, ncurses, m4, libsigsegv, mpi, openssl, qt, most of x11, etc.  Unfortunately, the issue has not so far been immediately amenable to solution.  I believe the barriers are fundamentally due to lack of standardization between Linux distros and underlying packages --- and solutions will require a lot of detailed work that is specific to each distro / package.\r\n\r\nWe have discussed this issue before.  General solutions are:\r\n\r\n1. Create (and maintain) OS-specific lists of which distros provide which Spack packages; see #2700 \r\n\r\n2. Try to mine a distro's `yum` or `dpkg` repository for information on which Spack packages are available (or could be made available with an appropraite `yum install` command).\r\n\r\n3. Try to auto-detect which version of a package is installed by finding and trying to execute the program (like the way configure / AutoMake do it).\r\n\r\nAll three of the above approaches are possible, but also have problems and require maintenance.  (1) isn't very flexible about allowing different users to include different packages from the system.  (2) gets into problems of identifying which Linux packages correspond to which Spack pacakges (would have to be maintained by hand).  (3) would require a different detection procedure for each Spack package, alongside the `install()` method.\r\n\r\nAll of these approaches bring up the problem that more often than not, the version supplied by the Linux distro is *older* than any of the versions currently supplied (or accounted for) by the Spack package.  This is probably a minor issue; so far, I've been working with it by adding those old versions to the Spack package.\r\n",
