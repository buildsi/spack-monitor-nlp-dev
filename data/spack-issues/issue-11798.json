    "body": "wrapperrpath variant of the MPICH package disables wrapper rpath when called with `~wrapperrapath`. It configures mpich with the arg `--enable-wrapper-rpath=no` when spack install is invoked with `~wrapperrpath` (e.g., `spack install mpich~wrapperrpath %gcc@7.3.0`). By default `--enable-wrapper-rpath` is set to yes. This option facilitates swapping MPI in the application built (with an mpich installed by spack with `~wrapperrpath`) with the system MPI (e.g., Cray MPICH with Shifter on Cori). ",
