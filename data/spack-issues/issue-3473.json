    "body": "I am trying to add a `resource` call to a package. I need to know which keywords arguments it expects. I currently cannot find this in the documentation.\r\n\r\nI notice two problems:\r\n- When I follow a link in a search result, I end up at the top of a very large page, where I have to search again. I expect to be placed near the term which I searched.\r\n- The two pages `spack package` and `Packaging Guide` both describe what I'm probably looking for, but they list different and incomplete keyword arguments. They also don't explain the meaning of the keyword arguments well.\r\n- The notion of a `FetchStrategy` seems to be important to understanding resources. This term should again be a hyperlink in the API reference, so that I can look up what it means.\r\n",
