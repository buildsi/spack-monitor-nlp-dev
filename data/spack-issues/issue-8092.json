    "body": "Fixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/8088\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/pull/7012 added a `@when` condition for a `@run_before` check to constrain that check to only run on Darwin. Spack doesn't appear to support the combination of `@when` and `@run_before` (or `@run_after`). This replaces the external decorator with a check that executes at the beginning of the function.",
