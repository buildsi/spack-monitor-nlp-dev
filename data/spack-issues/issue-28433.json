    "body": "From the `README.md`:\r\n\r\n> By default, NCCL is compiled for all supported architectures. To accelerate the compilation and reduce the binary size, consider redefining `NVCC_GENCODE` (defined in `makefiles/common.mk`) to only include the architecture of the target platform :\r\n> ```shell\r\n> $ make -j src.build NVCC_GENCODE=\"-gencode=arch=compute_70,code=sm_70\"\r\n> ```\r\n\r\nSuccessfully builds on RHEL 8.4 with GCC 8.5.0 and CUDA 11.4.2.",
