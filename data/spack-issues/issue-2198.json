    "body": "This PR activate subversion's make targets `swig-py` and `swig-pl` to provide python and Perl bindings.\r\n    \r\nTo build and install the Perl and python bindings for subversion, I needed to register new dependencies on swig, python and perl. The subversion build system requires that Makefile targets `swig-py`, `install-swig-py`, `swig-pl` and `install-swig-pl` to be called. Reference: [INSTALL](http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/subversion/trunk/INSTALL)\r\n    \r\nFor the systems I was working on, I also needed to register/use spack provided autoconf, automake, libtool, expat and pkg-config as build-only dependencies and I needed to call `./autogen.sh` from the source tree before running `configure`.\r\n\r\nI'm no expert in building subversion, so I'm asking for help with testing and reviewing this PR.  For example, the way the python bindings work looks a bit like a python extension in spack.  Maybe my implementation should be modified to use that infrastructure. Should these bindings be presented as variants instead of defaults?\r\n\r\n",
