    "body": "If I have a package X with variant XV1 and package Y, and X has a depends_on declaration like:\n\n```\nvariant('XV1', default=True)\ndepends_on(Y, when=\"+XV1\")\n```\n\nThen \n\n```\nspack install X ^Y %gcc@4.7.4\n```\n\nWould fail with a message stating Y is not a dependency of X. Adding +XV1 would succeed.\n\nA more concrete example is a boost install:\n\n```\nspack install boost %clang ^bzip2 %gcc\n==> Error: boost does not depend on bzip2\n```\n\nAdding +iostreams (which is enabled by default and activates the dependency on bzip2) works.\n",
