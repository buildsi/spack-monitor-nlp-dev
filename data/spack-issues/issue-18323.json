    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI have added HPC Challenge (HPCC) Benchmark to spack. HPCC consists of seven benchmarks (HPL, DGEMM, STREAM, PTRANS, RandomAccess, FFT and Communication bandwidth and latency). We use it for benchmarking and HPC resource performance monitoring during it lifetime.\r\n\r\nInstallation is based on MakefilePackage and includes simple workability test.\r\n\r\nI tested installation with gcc and intel compilers, openmpi and intel-mpi for MPI, openblas and mkl for linear algebra and fftw2 and mkl for FFT.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nNikolay",
