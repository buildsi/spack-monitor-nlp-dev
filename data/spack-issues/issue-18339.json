    "body": "This PR renames the smoke test utility for reading and escaping expected smoke test output from a file *and* makes it available to packages.  It also updates the five packages currently making use of the utility to use the new name.\r\n\r\nI also removed the unnecessary imports of Spack and \"standardized\" the test purpose for one test case/part/whatever it's called in this context.\r\n\r\nThis feature was requested in #18337 .",
