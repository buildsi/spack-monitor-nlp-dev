    "body": "**Adding ROMS package to Spack**\r\n\r\n-  Downloading ROMS source is different from other regular apps, to obtain ROMS source code one has to register first and download manually, hence Spack recipe expects ROMS source code to be manually downloaded and provided in the Spack's  parent folder\r\n- SHA256 value may differ from user to user, to avoid issues with checksum user can pass `--no-checksum` next to \"spack install\" in the build command\r\n- This pull request is aimed to provide AOCC compiler support for ROMS\r\n- ROMS build with GCC 8.4.1 is also successful \r\n\r\n_Tested Commands:_ \r\nAMD Toolchain:\r\n`spack install -v --no-checksum roms@3.8 %aocc@3.1.0 target=zen3 hdf5@1.10.7+hl+cxx+fortran ^netcdf-c@4.7.0 ^netcdf-fortran@4.5.2~shared ^openmpi@4.0.5`\r\n\r\nGNU:\r\n`spack install -v --no-checksum roms@3.8 %gcc@8.4.1 target=zen hdf5@1.10.7+hl+cxx+fortran ^netcdf-c@4.7.0 ^netcdf-fortran@4.5.2~shared ^openmpi@4.0.5`\r\n\r\n**Information on your system**\r\n> $ spack debug report\r\n> * **Spack:** 0.16.2-4218-5fa075f5b4\r\n> * **Python:** 3.9.5\r\n> * **Platform:** linux-centos8-zen3\r\n> * **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n",
