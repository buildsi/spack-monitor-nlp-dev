    "body": "I was trying to build packages on TOSS 2 after having spack's compilers configured for TOSS 3 and I got the following error:\n\n./bin/spack install graphlib@2.0.0\n==> Error: There are no valid versions for graphlib that match '2.0.0'\n\nI fixed this for myself by concatenating a TOSS 2 and TOSS 3 compiler.yaml, but perhaps there should be a more intuitive error message or some mechanism that looks for and auto populates a valid architecture in the compilers.yaml if none exists.\n",
