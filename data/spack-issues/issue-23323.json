I'm not suggesting that this actually gets populated on docker hub, but merely providing the recipe for those who wish to build a spack base container themselves may be useful.\r\n\r\nLmod fails to install in centos:8. I am therefore keeping this separate from #23322 which has no feature regressions.\r\n\r\n[Commit history refers to tutorial updates due to having originally been branched off releases/v0.16.]\r\n\r\n",
