    "body": "I've noticed a weird bug with my progress bar lately. When fetching a package, it instantly jumps to 100% and pauses. The cursor jumps back and forth across the line, but it remains at 100%. Eventually (after it actually finishes downloading) it continues to install the package. Has any of the progress bar logic been changed? I also updated to Python 2.7.11 and cURL 7.47.1 recently, so that may be causing the problem.\n\nAnother longstanding problem is that if the terminal is fewer than 80 characters wide, the progress bar spits out thousands of lines of comment symbols instead of overwriting the original line. It can't be that hard to dynamically determine the width of the terminal, right? Is this functionality part of Spack or is it part of an external dependency?\n",
