    "body": "The `--force` option for `spack activate` is supposed to activate an extension without activating its dependencies:\n\n```\n$ spack help activate\nusage: spack activate [-h] [-f] ...\n\npositional arguments:\n  spec         spec of package extension to activate.\n\noptional arguments:\n  -h, --help   show this help message and exit\n  -f, --force  Activate without first activating dependencies.\n```\n\nHowever, when I try to use it, it fails because it is trying to activate its dependencies as well:\n\n```\n$ spack activate --force py-matplotlib@1.5.1\n==> Error: py-cycler@0.10.0%gcc@6.1.0 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64-vv4brbw cannot be installed in python@2.7.12%gcc@6.1.0+tk~ucs4 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64-hfkksvc because it conflicts with py-cycler@0.10.0%gcc@6.1.0 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64-4ers5ny\n```\n",
