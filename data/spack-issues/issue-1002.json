    "body": "This is a first try for the package foam-extend a fork of OpenFOAM.\nIn theory this could work for openfoam to but I did not try.\n\nIn addition I could not install paraview, so I did not try the paraview variant. I can remove it as long as it is not tested.\n\nIn the same PR there is also a correction for a todo in the package scotch\n",
