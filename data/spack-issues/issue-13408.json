    "body": "Fixes #13404\r\n\r\nfd58c98 formats the `Stage`'s `archive_path` in `Stage.archive` (as part of `web.push_to_url`). This is not needed and if the formatted differs from the original path (for example if the archive file name contains a URL query suffix), then the copy fails.\r\n\r\nThis removes the formatting that occurs in `web.push_to_url`. Admittedly the archive path chosen by the stage should strip off strings like `?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Flibuuid%2F&ts=1433881396&use_mirror=iweb` from `libuuid-1.0.3.tar.gz?r=http%3A%2F%2Fsourceforge.net%2Fprojects%2Flibuuid%2F&ts=1433881396&use_mirror=iweb`, but that should be handled when the archive names are chosen (i.e. in `Stage.expected_archive_files`).\r\n\r\nSee also: https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/11117#discussion_r338301058",
