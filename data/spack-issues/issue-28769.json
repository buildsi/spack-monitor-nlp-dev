    "body": "Added support to LBANN, Hydrogen, DiHydrogen, and Aluminum to capture\r\na gcc-toolchain cxxflags argument and pass it to a CMAKE_CUDA_FLAG\r\nargument when set.  This helps deal with compiling with clang on\r\nsystems with old base gcc installations.\r\n\r\nAdded a dependency on py-scipy when enabling tests on LBANN.\r\n\r\nUpdated the C++ standard for Hydrogen to C++17.",
