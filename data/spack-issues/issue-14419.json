    "body": "Add conflicts for aarch64 and darwin.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIs there a way to specify 'platform=windows'?  The hpcviewer spack\r\nrecipe also doesn't work on windows, but I couldn't find an example\r\nfor that.  I thought spack runs on windows, right?\r\n\r\nAlso, the conflict for aarch64 doesn't really work.  On ARM, I get:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack install hpcviewer\r\n==> Error: There are no valid versions for hpcviewer that match ':'\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem is that conflicts happen after concretization and there is\r\nno version available for aarch64.  So, concretization fails before\r\nconflicts are checked and the 'helpful' message is never printed.\r\n\r\nThis is specific to a binary package where we have a different tar\r\nfile per platform, and this platform isn't supported, so there are no\r\nvalid versions.\r\n",
