    "body": "This change adds support for building the rocsolver-test client and teaches spack how to run the fast subset of tests. I don't know what the real minimum required versions of LAPACK and GoogleTest are. I just set the versions we used as the minimum and left the maximum unbounded.\r\n\r\nTo give it a spin, try:\r\n```\r\nspack install --verbose --test=root rocsolver@4.3.1~optimal\r\n```\r\n\r\n@haampie @srekolam @arjun-raj-kuppala",
