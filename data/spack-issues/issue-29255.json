I went into the build scripts that Intel uses and found that Intel builds Python twice, once with static libraries, and once with shared libraries. The static interpreter is used, but only the shared libraries are installed. This causes Spack to look for `libpython3.a`, but it doesn't exist.\r\n\r\nI get that this is a quirk of how Intel builds their Python distribution, but is there some sort of workaround I could use?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\n```\r\nprint(json.dumps(config))\r\n'\r\n==> [2022-02-24-21:53:28.823817] Creating stage lock spack-stage-clingo-bootstrap-spack-ho7bogyy6ccoz5s3tmw7ypuoamazhhpj\r\n==> [2022-02-24-21:53:28.827407] Error: RuntimeError: Unable to locate libpython3.9.a libraries in /apps/oneapi/intelpython/latest/lib\r\n\r\nspack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/python/package.py:889, in libs:\r\n        886                return LibraryList(os.path.join(macos_developerdir, ldlibrary))\r\n        887            else:\r\n        888                msg = 'Unable to locate {0} libraries in {1}'\r\n  >>    889                raise RuntimeError(msg.format(ldlibrary, libdir))\r\n        890        else:\r\n        891            library = self.config_vars['LIBRARY']\r\n        892\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-1372-6eef12cd10\r\n* **Python:** 3.9\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
