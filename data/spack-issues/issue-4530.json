    "body": "I have a package with many variants. How do I test all the logic I've added for each variant and (appropriate) combinations thereof and/or error detection of inappropriate combinations? Only option at present is manually invoking various `spack install` operations.\r\n\r\nBut, since spack knows all the variants for a package, a useful testing ability before submitting a pull request for a package would be a `spack install --all-variants`. I would probably do it also with `--fake` also but no need to assume that either.",
