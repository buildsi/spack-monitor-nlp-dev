    "body": "Add a helper as a base to build better libs etc. methods.  This should help with #28621 @glennpj.\r\n\r\nAs @haampie pointed out, llvm-config does *not* get along very well with `libllvm.so`, it's supposed to (it even has an option specifically for that case) but it doesn't.  If someone needs that, they should use libdir then libnames to get the appropriate setup then build the path themself.  For anything else though, shared-libs, static-libs, paths, flags, it works reliably in my experience.\r\n\r\nThe imports are not really related, but reduce the number of error prompts on this file by an immense amount when linting.",
