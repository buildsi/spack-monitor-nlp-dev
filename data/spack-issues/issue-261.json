    "body": "This is a stopgap until I can merge PR #120, which includes more robust concretization preferences.  This allows any number of versions in a package to be marked `preferred=True`.  Packages are now sorted by preference, _then_ most recent in concretization.  So you can mark directly in the package file what the preferred version is.\n\nPR #120 provides the infrastructure we need to express these types of preferences per-platform, per-compiler, etc. but this is a first step.  This also allows Python 2.7.11 to remain the default while we get the Python stack working with 3.5.\n\n@lee218llnl @alalazo @mplegendre: What do you think?\n- Adding `preferred=True` to a version directive will change its sort\n  order in concretization.\n- This provides us a rudimentary ability to keep the Spack stack\n  stable as new versions are added.\n- Having multiple stacks will come next, but this at least allows us\n  to specify default versions of things instead of always taking the\n  newest.\n",
