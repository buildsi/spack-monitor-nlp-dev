    "body": "When I install a package e.g. `spack install gromacs@5.1.4%cce@8.5.6`, and then I try to install the same package with a modified flag, e.g. `spack install gromacs@5.1.4%cce@8.5.6 cppflags=-O1`, spack tries to compile and install all of the dependencies for gromacs again.\r\n\r\nIs this the desired behavior? I feel like the dependencies can be kept as they are, and only the gromacs installation can be modified to use the extra flag.",
