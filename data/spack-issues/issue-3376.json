    "body": "[@adamjstewart This is in response to a recent thread, but I cannot find it right now]\r\n\r\nIn developing naming conventions (which is probably a good thing), I think we are placing too much burden on the *name* when trying to determine if a package is duplicate.  I suggest we look at a variety of factors to come to a conclusion that two packages are \"possibly duplicate.\"  Obvious factors to look at would be name and URL.\r\n\r\nIf we do this, then it will be less important that the name is *exactly* predictable in every. single. case.\r\n",
