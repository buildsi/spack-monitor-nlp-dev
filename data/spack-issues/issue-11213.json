    "body": "When using Spack Environments from a non-interactive shell (without the `TERM` variable) you will experience the follow:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack env activate .\r\n==> Error: 'TERM'\r\n$ spack env status\r\n==> Using spack.yaml in current directory: /ecp/gitlab-runner/pbryant/example-gitlab-ci/builds/users/pbryant/6da32c28/1/pbryant/example-gitlab-ci/test\r\n```\r\n\r\nUpon another review I realized this was still an exit status is 0 so as seen in the example the environment is activated; however, it is still something that makes sense to correct as the error message seems unnecessary.\r\n\r\n@becker33 - apologies for having to recreate the PR, I did not properly account for the changes in 10017.",
