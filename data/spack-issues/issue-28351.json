    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n`ossp-uuid`, `libuuid`, and `util-linux-uuid` all have `provide('uuid')`, however `ossp-uuid`'s interface is different from that of the other two packages (for instance it has `uuid_create` instead of `uuid_generate`). This poses problems for packages that have `depends_on('uuid')` and expect the interface provided by the latter two libraries. Clingo can arbitrarily choose to use ossp-uuid, making such packages fail to build properly.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\r\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
