    "body": "This pull request was originally intended as a way to simplify #99 \n\nAfter testing, I noticed the following problem:\n\n```\n$ spack versions cmake\n==> Error: Cannot fetch versions for package Cmake because it does not define any URLs to fetch.\n```\n\nBy adding a url variable, this problem is now solved:\n\n```\n$ spack versions cmake\n==> Safe versions (already checksummed):\n  3.4.3  3.4.0  3.3.1  3.0.2  2.8.10.2\n==> Remote versions (not yet checksummed):\n  3.4.2  3.4.1\n```\n\nWhile I was at it, I added the latest available version.\n",
