    "body": "first, fix `metis` with clang 7.3.0 (credits to Homebrew guys) and add some tests.\nsecond, fix an ugly bug where `suite-sparse` was build with internal `metis` (also cleanup suite-sparse build). That, i believe, lead to symbol collision for libraries which are build against both `metis` and `suite-sparse` (like `dealii`) and eventually resulted in Metis errors on OSX when calling `METIS_PartGraphKway` or `METIS_PartGraphRecursive`. Finally, add another test to `dealii` which uses `metis`.\n\nTested on OSX 10.11.4. with Clang 7.3.0.\n",
