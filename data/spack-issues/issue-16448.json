Expressly search for packages that are compatible with\r\n    packages already loaded.\r\n2.) Use information in packages.yaml to help narrow down results.\r\n3.) If no packages are located that are fit for use, calculate\r\n     what one would look like and provide a yaml file that can\r\n     be used to build one.",
