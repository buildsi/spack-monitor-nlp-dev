Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install trilinos%gcc@8.3.0+openmp ^cmake%clang@11.0.0-apple\r\n```\r\nThis is a well-known issue with GCC on MacOSX with XCODE 11.  It has to do with the `-isysroot` path.  If you don't include this path things seem to work out fine.  For example, most of our spack packages that compile using gcc use autoconf, which doesn't detect the sysroot.  It appears a work-around when using cmake may be to set the following:\r\n```cmake\r\nset(CMAKE_OSX_SYSROOT /Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/SDKs/MacOSX.sdk CACHE PATH \"\")\r\n```\r\nYou can get this path using\r\n```sh\r\nxcrun --show-sdk-path\r\n```\r\nI have used this to build Trilinos manually with GCC 8/9 on MacOSX and it compiles/tests successfully.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.1\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.3\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-mojave-skylake\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n**packages.yaml**:\r\n```yaml\r\n  trilinos:\r\n    variants:\r\n       +amesos +anasazi +aztec +belos +ifpack +teuchos gotype=long +epetra +epetraext +kokkos +ifpack2 +intrepid +ml +sacado +shards +tpetra +stratimikos ~adios2 ~alloptpkgs ~amesos2 ~boost ~cgns ~chaco ~complex ~debug ~dtk ~exodus +explicit_template_instantiation ~float +fortran ~fortrilinos ~glm   ~gtest +hdf5 ~hypre  ~intrepid2 ~isorropia ~matio ~mesquite ~metis ~minitensor ~muelu ~mumps ~netcdf ~nox ~openmp ~phalanx ~piro ~pnetcdf ~python ~rol ~rythmos +shared ~shylu ~stk ~suite-sparse ~superlu ~superlu-dist ~teko ~tempus ~x11 ~xsdkflags ~zlib ~zoltan ~zoltan2\r\n```\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
