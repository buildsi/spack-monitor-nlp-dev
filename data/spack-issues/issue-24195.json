    "body": "<!-- Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\nExample: \"I ran `spack find` to list all the installed packages and ...\" -->\r\n\r\nLoading the `intel-oneapi-compilers` module does not correctly unlock the path to packages compiled with it in the `lmod` module system.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nI installed the `intel-oneapi-compilers` package and used it to compile `openmpi-4.1.0`.\r\nThen I re-generated the `lmod` module files.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install intel-oneapi-compilers target=x86_64\r\n$ spack compiler add /opt/intel/oneapi/compiler/latest/linux/bin/intel64\r\n$ spack compiler add /opt/intel/oneapi/compiler/latest/linux/bin\r\n$ spack install openmpi+legacylaunchers@4.1.0 %intel@2021.2.0 target=x86_64\r\n$ spack module lmod refresh\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output. If there was no error message and no output but the result is incorrect, describe how it does not match what you expect. -->\r\nLoading the `intel-oneapi-compilers/2021.2.0` module works just fine\r\n```console\r\n$ module load intel-oneapi-compilers/2021.2.0\r\n```\r\nbut a subsequent `module avail` does not show the `openmpi/4.1.0` module to be unlocked by the previous load.\r\n\r\nI have looked into the module files created for `intel-oneapi-compilers`: `share/spack/modules/linux-centos8-x86_64/Core/intel-oneapi-compilers/2021.2.0.lua` and the problem appears to be that this module file does not prepend `share/spack/modules/linux-centos8-x86_64/intel/2021.2` to $MODULEPATH.\r\n\r\nAdding:\r\n```console\r\nprepend_path(\"MODULEPATH\", \"/opt/share/spack/share/spack/modules/linux-centos8-x86_64/intel/2021.2.0\")\r\n```\r\nto `share/spack/modules/linux-centos8-x86_64/Core/intel-oneapi-compilers/2021.2.0.lua` solves the problem.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-3000-e4a559a571\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos8-cascadelake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\nI've used the following `modules.yaml` file:\r\n```console\r\nmodules:\r\n  default:\r\n    lmod:\r\n      core_compilers:\r\n      - clang@10.0.1\r\n      - gcc@8.3.1\r\n      hierarchy:\r\n      - mpi\r\n      hash_length: 0\r\n      whitelist:\r\n      - gcc\r\n      - intel-oneapi-compilers\r\n      blacklist:\r\n      - '%gcc@8.3.1'\r\n      projections:\r\n        all: '{name}/{version}'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
