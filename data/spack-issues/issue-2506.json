    "body": "This PR contains two updates for the python package:\r\n1. A complement for #2295 to account for lib64 when doing the final step of the install method.\r\n2. Saves the original value of the LDSHARED variable in the _sysconfigdata.py before changing it from the spack's wrapper to the actual compiler. This variable is later passed to dependent package's setup.py to override the modified value in the _sysconfigdata.py when building with spack. This is necessary to force distutils to build shared libraries of python extensions with spack's wrapper but not with underlying compilers.",
