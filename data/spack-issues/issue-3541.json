    "body": "Also converts to `AutotoolsPackage`.\r\n\r\nI actually ran into a bug with the `guile` build system. It only searches for libraries in `lib`, not `lib64`. I tried using my system `libtool` installation, but it wouldn't pick up `libltdl` because it was installed in `/usr/lib64`. I submitted a bug report. This shouldn't affect the Spack package, as our `libtool` installs its libraries into `<prefix>/lib`.",
