On ORNL's Summit, pkg-config can't find json-c.pc. The difference is that on my Ubuntu machine this file is located in the package's `lib` directory, while on Summit it ends up in a `lib64` directory, which isn't in `PKG_CONFIG_PATH`. I don't know why this difference happens, but I suspect it could happen with other packages. `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` should contain such `lib64` directories when they are present.\n\n### Error message\n\n_No response_\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-1507-89e2ee70e2\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-power9le\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
