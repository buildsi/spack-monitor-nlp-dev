    "body": "This fixes a compile error caused by a more aggressive optimiser in gcc8, fixed in mainline python2 starting at 2.7.15. I have no idea which other versions of python are affected (From the discussion on their mailing list I assume <3.5 and <2.7.14) and don't have the time to test build a lot of python's. I don't think that this will hit a lot of people in practice, but should be included anyway",
