    "body": "as per comment https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/1243#issuecomment-233552475 , figure out a better way to add Blas/Lapack tests to packages which would require less amount of code in `package.py` and avoid duplication. \n\nOne way i see is to introduce a dummy package `test-blas.py` and `test-lapack.py` which would `depends_on('blas')` and `depends_on('lapack')`. We would then be able to build them against any package which implements blas/lapack and test if the interface is working and correct.\n\nEven better would be to have tests as a part of virtual package declaration somehow and then make them run by `spack test atlas/openblas/mkl` etc. So there will be one place where tests are defined and every package which implements a virtual package need to pass the test.\n",
