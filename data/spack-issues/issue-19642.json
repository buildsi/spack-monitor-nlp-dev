    "body": "This changes the ROOT package to use the newish `CMakePackage.define` and `CMakePackage.define_from_variant` instead of a custom `_process_opts` script. Since `define_from_variant` checks the existence of the variant name, it discovered that four configuration options (minimal, odbc, roofit, veccore) were implicitly being set to False. For the time being I've preserved the existing behavior by explicitly defining those to false, but I'd be happy to add the variants, change the defaults, or remove the definitions as needed. Thanks!",
