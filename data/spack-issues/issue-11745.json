    "body": "Spack version: commit a45c4ef33de (if no change on relevant part, it is basically the head).\r\nOS distribution: Ubuntu server 18.04.\r\n\r\nAfter `spack install rclone`, there is a folder named go outside spack installation root as `~/go/` (the spack root is `~/spack/`). I have no idea about go lang, but it seems to be the go packages directory, denoted as `$GOPATH`.\r\n\r\nI wonder whether it is necessary to leave something outside spack root or should it be simple to move such GOPATH within spack root by hacking some repos (such as go or rclone).\r\n\r\nBTW, \r\n```bash\r\nmodule show go-1.11.5-gcc-7.4.0-gm\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n   /home/ubuntu/spack/share/spack/modules/linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64/go-1.11.5-gcc-7.4.0-gm:\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------\r\nwhatis(\"The golang compiler and build environment \")\r\nprepend_path(\"PATH\",\"/home/ubuntu/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64/gcc-7.4.0/go-1.11.5-gmcvqdwr6az4hxbicr375if5fttk6sna/bin\")\r\nprepend_path(\"LD_LIBRARY_PATH\",\"/home/ubuntu/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64/gcc-7.4.0/go-1.11.5-gmcvqdwr6az4hxbicr375if5fttk6sna/lib\")\r\nprepend_path(\"LIBRARY_PATH\",\"/home/ubuntu/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64/gcc-7.4.0/go-1.11.5-gmcvqdwr6az4hxbicr375if5fttk6sna/lib\")\r\nprepend_path(\"CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH\",\"/home/ubuntu/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64/gcc-7.4.0/go-1.11.5-gmcvqdwr6az4hxbicr375if5fttk6sna/\")\r\nhelp([[The golang compiler and build environment\r\n]])\r\n```\r\nThe auto generated module file for go by spack has no modification on `$GOPATH`.\r\n\r\nCorrect me if I have any misunderstanding on go or its way of doing things, since literally I know nothing about it.",
