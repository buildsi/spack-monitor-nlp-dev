    "body": "### Flang support\r\n\r\nThis involves two high-level tasks.\r\n\r\n1. Update the \"clang\" compiler object in Spack to find and use the flang compiler for fortran by default\r\n\r\n2. Update the LLVM package.py to include the latest version (11) and have the ability to utilize the flang/f18 that is now included in LLVM.  \r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nTake advantage of LLVM's Fortran compiler in order to not have to add gfortran to the compilers.yaml configuration after install.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTask 1: Add executable names and ensure version checks work for flang\r\n\r\nTask 2: Include a new variant to utilize flang/f18 (or disable it's use) and install accordingly.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nhttps://releases.llvm.org/11.0.0/docs/ReleaseNotes.html\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
