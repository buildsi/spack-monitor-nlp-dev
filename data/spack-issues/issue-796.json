    "body": "All,\n\nHere is my initial implementation of the Intel compiler package, addressing #761. It currently distinguishes between the \"cluster\", \"professional\", and \"composer\" editions. This whole thing is admittedly a bit of a mess, so feedback is much appreciated, particularly w.r.t. how versions and variants are being handled. A lot of the mess is due to flexibility I tried adding and we can certainly clean things up by just setting components to \"ALL\" and not allow the removal of the libraries. I know here at LLNL, we don't care much about daal and ipp, and both take up a lot of disk space. \n\nThe package will need to be updated to use the license features of #553 and in the meantime you will have to set your license_path appropriately.\n",
