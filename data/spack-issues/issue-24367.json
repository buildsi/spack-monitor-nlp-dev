    "body": "Spack currently allows manual manipulation of the default modules, but does not allow module defaults as a configurable option.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes module defaults configurable from the modules yaml section. It adds a per-module-set key \"defaults\", which takes a list of spec strings. Any spec that satisfies any default spec is considered a default, and a symlink named default is created next to, and pointing to, its modulefile. (Note: if multiple packages have modulefiles in the same directory and are listed as defaults, the last one installed will be left as the default).\r\n\r\nThis will allow facility staff greater flexibility with advanced module configuration.\r\n\r\nIncludes testing and documentation.",
