If this machine uses a batch system\r\nto submit jobs you will need to configure using ./configure with the additional option  --with-batch.\r\n Otherwise there is problem with the compilers. Can you compile and run code with your compiler '/data/stas/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/intel-17.0.4/intel-mpi-2017.3.196/compilers_and_libraries/linux/mpi/intel64/bin/mpiifort'?\r\nSee http://www.mcs.anl.gov/petsc/documentation/faq.html#libimf\r\n```\r\nI installed  it manually with the same compilers and it worked ok.\r\n",
