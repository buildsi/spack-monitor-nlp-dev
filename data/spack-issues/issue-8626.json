    "body": "From #8362:\r\n\r\n> While we do have deployed infrastructure, we still need a few items to deploy production-ready infrastructure. At the very least, we will need a domain name for the gitlab instance, a domain name for the cdash instance, certificates for the two, and while we're at it, it would be a good opportunity to secure gpg keys for package signing. ...\r\n\r\nThis issue will track our progress towards securing the following assets:\r\n\r\n- [x] Domain name for Spack's gitlab instance (gitlab.spack.io?)\r\n- [x] Domain name for Spack's cdash instance (cdash.spack.io?)\r\n- [x] Web certificate for Spack's gitlab instance.\r\n- [x] Web certificate for Spack's cdash instance.\r\n- [ ] GPG Keys for package signing. (not necessary right now, but might want to have it ready for when we need it)",
