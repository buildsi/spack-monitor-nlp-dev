    "body": "Resolves #1332.  \n- OpenSSL no longer checks remote versions on the openssl site.\n- Spack is used on systems that aren't connected to the internet, and\n  this check is probably in the wrong place and affects too many\n  commands.  We can work on figuring out a better, more configurable\n  place to put a check like this.\n\n@alalazo @KineticTheory @citibeth @adamjstewart \n",
