    "body": "While working on and trying to install `py-yt`, Spack installed `py-scipy` as dependency. When the install of `py-yt` failed, I corrected its package, and tried to install it again. Spack then began by re-installing `py-scipy`. I don't know why -- nothing in this package on its dependencies changed, and none of their variants changed either. However, the hash is different.\n\nI still have the respective prefix directories of `py-scipy` if that helps.\n\nI've seen this problem several times with several different packages; currently, Spack is re-installing `py-scikit`.\n",
