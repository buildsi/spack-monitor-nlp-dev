    "body": "I'm seeing some strange behavior with the nwchem package. If you hack the package to add:\r\n```python\r\nurl = \"http://www.nwchem-sw.org/images/Nwchem-6.6.revision27746-src.2015-10-20.tar.gz\"\r\n```\r\nand run:\r\n```\r\n$ spack versions nwchem\r\n==> Error: Couldn't detect version in: http://www.nwchem-sw.org/images/Notdir_fc.patch.gz\r\n```\r\nThis URL comes from `urls_for_patches`. Any idea why it would be picked up instead of the package-level `url`?",
