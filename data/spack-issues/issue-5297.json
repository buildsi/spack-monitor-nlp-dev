    "body": "Fixes #5293 \r\n\r\nThis is a WIP PR to address a case where `spack module loads` fails when a package is removed from the spack repository but is present as an installed package. Spack saves a copy of the package repo in every package installation prefix (for the package and its dependencies) so this retrieves that repo when constructing module files.",
