    "body": "### Summary\n\nStand-alone/smoke tests should ensure the package's environment is set properly prior to running the tests.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThere are some environments and situations (e.g., MacOS) where you cannot run stand-alone tests without first running `spack load` on the associated package.  This is inconvenient at best.\n\n### Description\n\nSpack test should `load` the package's environment settings prior to running the tests.\n\n### Additional information\n\n```\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.16.2-4030-af2f07852c\r\n```\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
