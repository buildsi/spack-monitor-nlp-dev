    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nJust some small fixes for the font-util package:\r\n1. Remove duplicated dependencies: cosmetic change.\r\n2. Fix path handling for font resources: avoid doing nonsensical `join_path` like `join_path('encodings', '/tmp/.../spack-stage/spack-stage-1g54sz/spack-src/encodings/encodings-1.0.4')`.\r\n\r\nR\u00e9mi",
