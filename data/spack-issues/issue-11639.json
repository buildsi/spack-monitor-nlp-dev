    "body": "Add an example of a 'modules:' entry for an external package in\r\npackages.yaml.  The 'External Packages' section of 'Build\r\nCustomization' mentions 'paths:' and 'modules:' and gives an\r\nexample of paths, but not modules.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI was showing someone how to set up a `packages.yaml` file for an\r\nexternal (not spack built) module and I told him, \"Look, it's right\r\nhere in the docs.\"  Except it wasn't, so ....\r\n\r\nAlso, when I first tried this, I was confused about the correct\r\ndirectory for paths.  Cmake was in `/usr/bin/cmake`, so my first try\r\nwas `/usr/bin`, which is not correct.  So, I added one sentence for\r\nthat.",
