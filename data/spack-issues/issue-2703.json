    "body": "This PR adds the versions of packages that are provided with CentOS7.  Benefits:\r\n\r\n 1. Packages specified as `buildable=False` work better if Spack knows about the version number.  Previously, I had to lie about which version of Python was provided by my system (`2.7.8` instead of the actual `2.7.5`, which Spack didn't know about).\r\n\r\n 2. Users not on CentOS7 can replicate the CentOS7 experience.  Ooh fun...\r\n\r\nThis PR also converts to `AutotoolsPackage` and `CMakePackage` as appropriate.",
