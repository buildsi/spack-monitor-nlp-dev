    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nWe have an issue on our machine where AVX512-enabled FFTW builds are something like 3 times slower than AVX2 builds.\r\n\r\nWhile trying to figure out this with the FFTW devs, we would like to override the automatic SIMD choice made by the Spack package based on the detected architecture (Intel Cascade Lake 6248).\r\n\r\nI know I can force another arch when installing but it would create the corresponding module files in the wrong directory.\r\n\r\nThat would be the clever way to deal with this kind of issue?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nR\u00e9mi",
