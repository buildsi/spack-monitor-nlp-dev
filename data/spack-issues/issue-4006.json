    "body": "Test scripts now build `libdwarf`, `HDF5` and `py-numpy` in parallel with the unit tests.  This also reworks and simplifies the test scripts a bit, so they're easier to maintain.\r\n\r\n- [x] Move build tests out of the regular Travis unit tests, add more smoke test packages to build.\r\n\r\n- [x] Run all test scripts with bash -e, which fails on error.\r\n\r\n- [x] Factor coverage out into a Travis environment variable, so it's more obvious from .travis.yml which tests contribute to coverage and which don't.\r\n\r\n- [x] Factor dependency checking and much of the front-matter in tests scripts into a setup.sh script, which is sourced by all the test scripts.  Extra cruft in each tests script now reduced to 2 lines at the beginning.",
