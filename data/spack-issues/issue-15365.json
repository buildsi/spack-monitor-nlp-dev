    "body": "Closes #13256\r\n\r\nIt looks like 3.8.2 is significantly less buggy than 3.8.0. I was able to install NumPy with this version and it passed all tests with no issues. I think we should still keep Python 3.7 as preferred until Anaconda and Homebrew update to Python 3.8.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully builds on macOS 10.15.3 with Clang 11.0.0.",
