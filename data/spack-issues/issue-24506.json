    "body": "In working on a new unittest for the checking spec install status, I discovered that when clingo concretizes a spec with an\r\nexternal_path defined that information is lost. This appears to happen because the spec objects generated by the Clingo solver don't maintain that information, and the original spec has those attributes overwritten by the concretized Spec via the `._dup()` method. It's likely that other crucial information from the original Spec isn't preserved as well.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nWhile using the clingo concretizer:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nspec = Spec(\"myspec\", external_path='/foo/bar')\r\nprint(spec.external_path, spec.external)\r\nspec.concretize()\r\nprint(spec.external_path, spec.external)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nN/A\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nClingo doesn't bootstrap on my system, so I ended up debugging this slowly through github unittests.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
