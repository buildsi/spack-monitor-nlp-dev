    "body": "Changes: \r\n\r\n* Add the new release, and a missing older one.\r\n\r\n* Remove the spack package cruft for supporting the obsolete build system that\r\n  was present in older versions that are no longer supported.\r\n\r\n* General cleanups.\r\n\r\nSupport for library versions older than 2020.3.0 is officially retired,\r\nfor two reasons:\r\n\r\n1. Releases prior to 2020.3.0 had a required dependency on Python 2,\r\n   which is [officially EOL](https://www.python.org/doc/sunset-python-2/)\r\n   as of Jan 1 2020, and is no longer considered secure.\r\n2. (Most importantly) The UPC++ development team is unable/unwilling to\r\n   support releases more than two years old.  UPC++ provides robust\r\n   backwards-compatibility to earlier releases of UPC++ v1.0, with very\r\n   rare well-documented/well-motivated exceptions.  Users are strongly\r\n   encouraged to update to a current version of UPC++.\r\n\r\nNOTE: Most of the lines changed in this commit are simply re-indentation,\r\nand thus might be best reviewed in a diff that ignores whitespace.\r\n",
