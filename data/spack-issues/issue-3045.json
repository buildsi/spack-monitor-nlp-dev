    "body": "@tgamblin I'm not sure when this creeped back up, but I notice that pygtk and pygobject are not creating the appropriate gtk.pth and gobject.pth files in the site-packages directory:\r\n\r\n[lee218@opal186:spack]$ ll /nfs/tmp2/lee218/pkg/spack/opt/spack/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.9.3/py-pygtk-2.24.0-vwz4gz3lofwe436bjfzjdi3tgx7mcy63/lib/python2.7/site-packages/\r\ntotal 32\r\ndrwx------ 3 lee218 lee218 2048 Feb  6 13:40 gtk-2.0\r\n\r\nI thought having this path in $PYTHONPATH at build time, which Spack appears to be doing properly, used to suffice, so I'm not sure why this is broken. Anyone have any quick insights before I try to dig into this deeper?",
