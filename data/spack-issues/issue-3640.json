    "body": "Perl has development releases, but they aren't recommended. I added them and kept the latest maintenance release as preferred. See http://www.cpan.org/src/README.html\r\n\r\nI also added some older versions of Perl. These are required for another package (PR incoming).\r\n\r\nI converted Perl to use separate configure, build, and install phases to match how most of our other packages work. I confirmed that the latest preferred Perl release still builds and passes all tests.",
