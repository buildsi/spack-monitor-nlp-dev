    "body": "The ability of CMake to find the `hdf5+hl` component has been broken since `hdf5` was switched to a `CMakePackage`. This solves it, but I'm guessing the way I'm doing this will be met with opposition. So I welcome any better way to do this. It's unfortunate the Autotools and CMake ways of installing `hdf5` are so different.",
