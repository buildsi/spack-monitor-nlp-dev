    "body": "Fixes #5455 \r\n\r\nAll methods within `setup_package` use an EnvironmentModifications object to control the environment. Those modifications are applied at the end of `setup_package`. Module loads for the build environment need to be done after the rest of the environment modifications are applied, as otherwise Spack will unset variables set by those modules.\r\n\r\nThis is a quick fix, but I don't see a more elegant solution to this problem.",
