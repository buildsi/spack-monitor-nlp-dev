    "body": "A package (`julia`) failed to build. I want to re-build from scratch, and say `spack clean julia`. This does not seem to do anything; the next `spack install julia` immediately stops with the same error message. The source and build directories are not deleted, and `make` resumes where it stopped earlier.\n\nI expect `spack clean` to delete the left-over build directory.\n",
