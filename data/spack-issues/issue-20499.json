    "body": "Most people installing `clingo` with Spack are going to be doing it to use the new concretizer, and that requires the `master` branch for unsatisfiable core support.\r\n\r\n- [x] make `master` the default so we don't have to keep telling people to install `clingo@master`. We'll update the preferred version when there's a new release.",
