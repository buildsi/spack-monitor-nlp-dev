    "body": "<!--*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*-->\r\nSpack environments need some way to preserve the build recipes that built a Spack.lock file.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\n<!--*Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it!*-->\r\n\r\nSpack environments, in practice, have poor reproducibility via Spack.lock because changes in the package recipe can result in a change in the package hashes. This means you can't use a newer version of spack with an older Spack.lock file. Without preserving the recipes, or knowing the precise Spack commit hash that produced a Spack.lock, you have very little chance of reproducing the exact environment from a Spack.lock file.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!--*Describe the solution you'd like and the alternatives you have considered.*-->\r\n\r\nI'd like the package.py files used to build a spack.lock to be preserved in some way with the spack.lock file. Perhaps by embedding them into the spack.lock file. But I don't have a strong preference on the precise solution.",
