    "body": "This PR allows us to find significantly more versions of software available on GitHub. The way that it works is essentially by adding the `releases` page of a GitHub repository as an additional `list_url`. Previously, we would only do this when the URL pointed to the archive page, but there are plenty of other URLs that we can pick up as well. For example:\r\n```\r\nhttps://github.com/ArtifexSoftware/ghostpdl-downloads/releases/download/gs9.18/ghostscript-9.18.tar.gz\r\n```\r\nPreviously, `spack versions` picked up no versions. Now, it picks up several versions. For a full list of packages that this likely affects, run:\r\n```\r\n$ spack url list | grep github | grep -v archive\r\n```\r\n@mjwoods This is the idea I mentioned.",
