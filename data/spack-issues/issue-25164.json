    "body": "<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2. Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nSet up a spack environment to use the clingo concretizer by adding\r\n\r\n  config:\r\n    concretizer: clingo\r\n\r\nto the spack.yaml file. Then run:\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack concretize\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-3738-b4c6c11e68\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.13\r\n* **Platform:** cray-sles15-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nI encountered this issue on the Spock EA system so out of an abundance of caution I'm excising the full error output in case there's something NDA-adjacent in there. Let me know what more information might be useful. Selected error output without full paths:\r\n\r\ncmake-3.20.5-buohxldhbe7xzsyhnt76m5tanfjbmnty/share/cmake-3.20/Modules/FindPackageHandleStandardArgs.\r\n          cmake:230 (message):\r\n     9      Could NOT find Python (missing: Python_LIBRARIES Interpreter Development\r\n     10     Development.Module Development.Embed)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n@alalazo\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
