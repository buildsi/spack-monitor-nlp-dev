    "body": "* Provide a new python package `py-cmake-format`. This package is similar to the familiar _clang-format_, but it standardizes the format of CMake files, https://pypi.python.org/pypi/cmake-format\r\n   * Requires a slightly newer version of `py-six`, so I updated that `package.py` in the same PR.\r\n```\r\ncmake-format project provides Quality Assurance (QA) tools for cmake.\r\n\r\n- cmake-annotate can generate pretty HTML from your listfiles\r\n- cmake-format   can format your listfiles nicely so that they don\u2019t look \r\n                 like crap.\r\n- cmake-lint     can check your listfiles for problems\r\n- ctest-to       can parse a ctest output tree and translate it into a more \r\n                 structured format (either JSON or XML).\r\n```",
