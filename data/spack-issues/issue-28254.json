    "body": "#27543 changed the deptype of py-pyzmql -> libzmq from build,link (default) to build,run. This is incorrect, as libzmq is linked as a shared library, and breaks dependent builds, like py-jupyterlab-server, which fails with:\r\n```\r\nImportError: .../lib/python3.8/site-packages/zmq/backend/cython/message.cpython-38-x86_64-linux-gnu.so: undefined symbol: zmq_msg_gets\r\n```\r\n(because it's picking up the wrong libzmq from the system). Changing this back (explicitly) fixes things.",
