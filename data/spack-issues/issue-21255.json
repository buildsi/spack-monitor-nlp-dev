    "body": "This PR adds a new version of Autoconf together with:\r\n1. A patch that fixes a bug in version `2.70` (will be fixed upstream in the next release: https://savannah.gnu.org/support/?110396).\r\n2. A fix for the way we patch shebang in `bin/autom4te.in`. We need to keep the original modification timestamp of the file. Otherwise, we either get an empty man page for `autom4te` (versions `2.69` and before) or a failure at the build time (versions `2.70` and after). The difference has to do with the update of the `missing` script: https://git.savannah.gnu.org/cgit/automake.git/commit/lib/missing?id=a22717dffe37f30ef2ad2c355b68c9b3b5e4b8c7\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will take time until developers of Autotools-based packages adjust their scripts to the new version, therefore, `2.69` is marked as `preferred`.",
