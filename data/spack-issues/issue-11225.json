    "body": "https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/11152 added documentation for https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/8772 but some details were based on an earlier implementation that had changed by the time #8772 was merged. In particular, #11152 mentioned that upstream Spack instances were configured in `config.yaml`, when in fact they should be placed in a separate `upstreams.yaml` config file; this PR updates the documentation accordingly.",
