    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nI'm writing a Spack package to install a library. When the compiler links to the library, I'd like it to use a custom flag e.g \"-xyz\" rather than prepending the \"-l\" similar to how the Intel Math Libraries are linked with \"-mkl\".\r\n\r\nI've read through the documentation and can't seem to find how to specify how other software should link against a custom library. Can someone help with this?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nLucas",
