    "body": "Closes #2910.\r\n\r\nPreviously, `spack module` would default to `tcl`. If you added a `modules.yaml` like:\r\n```yaml\r\nmodules:\r\n  enable::\r\n    - lmod\r\n```\r\n`spack module refresh` would crash. Now, `spack module` defaults to whatever is in your `modules.yaml`.\r\n\r\nIf you have multiple modules enabled, it uses the first. This defaults to `tcl` on my computer, but since it's a dict, it might be sorted differently for other users. Perhaps we should set the default `modules.yaml` to enable just `tcl` instead of `tcl` + `dotkit`?\r\n\r\nPersonally, I would like `spack module` to default to all enabled modules, not just the first one. But I'm not sure if that makes sense for all of the `spack module` subcommands. Thoughts? We could allow multiple module types for these commands.",
