    "body": "GCC looks for included files based on several env vars.\r\nRemove `C_INCLUDE_PATH`, `CPLUS_INCLUDE_PATH`, and `OBJC_INCLUDE_PATH` from the build environment to ensure it's clean and prevent accidental clobbering.\r\n\r\nI had encountered difficulties in building certain packages (notably `py-pandas`) after having loaded spack modules; I was building with GCC, but some of the loaded modules had been built with Intel and had loaded its internal include path in `C_INCLUDE_PATH`, which clobbered GCC's internal `<float.h>` and suppressed the definition of `DBL_MIN_EXP` and `DBL_MAX_EXP` (Intel's `float.h` only defines these macros when the compiler is actually Intel).",
