    "body": "Successfully builds on macOS 10.15.7 with Python 3.9.9.\r\n\r\nThis is the first stable release of `py-black`. I'm planning on deprecating and eventually removing the pre-release versions we had in the package. However, this new release removes Python 2 support. @tgamblin I'm not sure if we want to keep these old versions around to help blacken Spack or not.",
