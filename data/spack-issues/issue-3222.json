    "body": "@mplegendre @tgamblin Dyninst 9.3.0 requires libelf.so.1, otherwise it may seg fault on attach (https://github.com/dyninst/dyninst/issues/336). It looks like the libelf package does not supply this, but the elfutils package does. Would it make sense to make libelf a virtual package and have the libelf and elfutils packages provide it? The virtual package could be named something different too if the conflict causes issues.\r\n\r\nThis also leads to another issue, which is how to deal with the fact that elfutils packages up utilities like ar and ld.When a package depends_on elfutils, it brings those versions of the utilities into the PATH, which can cause issues.",
