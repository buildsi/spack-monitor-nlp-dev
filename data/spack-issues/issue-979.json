    "body": "Adding the `+metis` variant to make optional the installation of the metis.h and parmetis.h files to avoid collision for softwares using both metis and scotch.\n\nI also changes the way esmumps is used to not have to patch the make files of scotch. Just downloading the good file.\n\nI also remove the call of configure from install to follow a remark of @tgamblin  in #231 \n\n@xjrc : I tried to compile the version 5.1.10b and 6.0.0 with +esmumps/~esmumps and +mpi/~mpi\nplus some version with +metis/~metis, and did not get any trouble. Can you check if it still works for you.\n",
