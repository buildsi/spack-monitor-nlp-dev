    "body": "The workaround for the gcc10 error _should_ be fine, given it's just removing an unimplemented virtual destructor.\r\n\r\nIt's really weird though. It only causes an error with spack install, the same compiler works fine outside of spack, and running the process manually inside of 'spack build-env diamond bash' also works fine. ",
