    "body": "When I install packages using the standard `spack install ...` commands, it often leaves staging directories in `/tmp/eschnett` behind. Over time, these become very large. Spack should clean up automatically.\n\nFor example, after installing PETSc successfully, Spack should clean all previous PETSc staging directories that it left behind.\n\nOr maybe it should only using a single staging directory for PETSc, and not a new one for each attempt.\n\nAs is, the amount of disk space used is a trap; people might not even be aware of it.\n",
