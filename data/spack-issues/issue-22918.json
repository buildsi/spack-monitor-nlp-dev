    "body": "I realized the default build type for `CMakePackage` in spack is `build_type [RelWithDebInfo]`.\r\n\r\nThat's cool (I do the same for my projects) because `-g` comes with no real (runtime) cost and adds understanding on crashes; but there is an important detail: due to legacy reasons, most compilers are set up with `-O2` on that build type:\r\nhttps://github.com/ECP-WarpX/WarpX/issues/1201\r\nhttps://github.com/ECP-WarpX/WarpX/pull/1203\r\n\r\nAre we aware of that and change this somewhere back to `-O3`? Otherwise `Release` might be a better default :)\r\n\r\nMore background in this thread: https://gitlab.kitware.com/cmake/cmake/-/merge_requests/591",
