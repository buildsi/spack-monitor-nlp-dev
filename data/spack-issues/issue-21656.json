    "body": "#21442 missed a few places in unit tests where the store was monkeypatched within tests. This may cause spurious failures, since monkeypatching was not done consistently over all the global variables in `spack.store`.\r\n\r\nOther modifications:\r\n\r\n- [x] `spack.store.use_store` has been updated to also swap `spack.store.db`, `spack.store.layout`, `spack.store.root` and `spack.store.unpadded_root`\r\n- [x] `spack.store.store` is serialized in `subprocess_context.py` on Python > 3.8 + MacOS",
