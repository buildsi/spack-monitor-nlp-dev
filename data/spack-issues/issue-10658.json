    "body": "I was getting the error message with `spack install autoconf`:\r\n```\r\nautom4te: cannot create /gpfsm/dnb53/tdirs/login/discover32.13546.rpfische/am4t8860.25474: 2\r\n```\r\nInspection showed that `discover32.13546.rpfische` did not exist.  I am on a shared supercomputer where, in their infinite wisdom, the sysadmins decided to set my `$TMPDIR` in a particular way when I logged in.  I feel that should be respected, i.e. temporary files should be created there.  I use `spack install --dirty` because --- among other things --- the Intel compilers and MPI and git, etc. don't work unless you have just the right modules loaded.\r\n\r\n`TMPDIR` gets picked up and used by some packages (such as `autoconf`). But `TMPDIR` is not actually created on my system, it's just set as an env var.  Thus, the package's build cannot create what it needs to create inside of `TMPDIR`.\r\n\r\nThis problem could be approached by patching the package's build, or by updating the Spack recipe.  I chose the latter.\r\n",
