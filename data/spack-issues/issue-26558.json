    "body": "Add v5.3.0 to Superlu which includes multiple new features.\r\n\r\n**Changelog:**\r\n\r\n- Added \"options\" input argument for the driver routines. This structure contains all the parameter settings.\r\n- Added \"stat\" output argument for the driver routines. This structure contains all the statistics collected at run-time. \r\n- The driver routines xGSSV/xGSSVX have new interfaces reflecting the above changes.\r\n- Added a \"symmetric mode\" which gives better performance when the matrix is or diagonally heavy, or symmetric and/or positive definite, or nearly so. In this mode, the algorithm attempts to select pivots on the diagonal.\r\n- Better Fortran interface. See FORTRAN/ directory, and README in that directory.\r\n\r\n**Test Plan:**\r\nSuperlu v5.3.0 built successfully within the Autamus Workflow [here](https://github.com/autamus/registry/actions/runs/1303965897).",
