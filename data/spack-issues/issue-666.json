    "body": "There seems to be a problem with the config parser not using the user scope. I have the following in my modules configuration:\n\n```\ncat $HOME/.spack/modules.yaml\n\nmodules:\n  enable: ['tcl']\n```\n\nInstalls will still create dotfiles though because the user scope is not being used.\n\n```\nspack config get modules\n\nmodules:\n  enable:\n  - tcl\n  - dotkit\n```\n\nshows the site scope although I expected the user scope to take precedence. The following should definitely show the user scope but still shows the site scope.\n\n```\nspack config --user get modules\n\nmodules:\n  enable:\n  - tcl\n  - dotkit\n```\n",
