[y/N] n\r\n==> Error: Will not fetch openssl@1.0.1e\r\nIf you are willing to be a maintainer for this version of the package, submit a PR to remove `deprecated=False`, or use `--deprecated` to skip this check.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to implement the package-level arg, but we can always apply the arg to all versions of a package.",
