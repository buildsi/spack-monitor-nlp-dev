    "body": "Increase the connect timeout for elfutils to 60 sec.  Elfutils (and\r\nbzip2) tar files are on sourceware.org which is often slow to respond.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nIn addition to bzip2, I've also sometimes had trouble with elfutils timing out,\r\nas in #15212.  So the connection timeout is a welcome addition.\r\n\r\n@michaelkuhn Is there a way to specify the fetch options once per package?\r\nOr, is it necessary to add this for every version as in bzip2?\r\n",
