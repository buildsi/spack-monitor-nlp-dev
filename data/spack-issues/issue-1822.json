    "body": "This fixes #1520\n\nSome packages which include resources fetched from source control\nrepositories terminated package installs because they failed to\narchive; specifically, this affected all SCM resources which identify\na specific state of the repo - for example a revision in svn or a\ntag/revision in git. This is because the resource stage creation\nlogic did not choose an appropriate archive name for these kinds of\nresources.\n\nThis commit changes the archive filenames of URL-based resources; this\nwas not strictly necessary but has the added benefit that the URL\nbasename no longer needs to uniquely identify the resource - for\nexample if different versions of the same resource have the same name\nbut are stored in different directories.\n",
