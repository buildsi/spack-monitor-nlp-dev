    "body": "I recently added a compiler flag (`-O2`) in `compilers.yaml`, and since then, Spack keeps trying rebuilding all the \"common\" packages such as automake, autoconf, perl, pkgconf. Moreover, every compiler wants to build all those packages again.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nI'd like to \"fix\" certain packages already built by spack, similarly to the `buildable: False` flag that we can use on external packages: https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_settings.html#external-packages\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'd like to have a new key in `packages.yaml` that accepts multiple specs (that should already be installed), to be used with `buildable = False`, something like:\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  autoconf:\r\n    use_these: [\"2.69%gcc@4.8.5\", \"2.69%intel/fv24k4o\"]\r\n    buildable: False\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIt's somewhat similar to #5254.\r\nIf you find this idea useful, I can start working on a PR.",
