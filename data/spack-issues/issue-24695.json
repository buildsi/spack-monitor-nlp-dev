    "body": "We enabled import order checking in #23947, but fixing things manually drives people crazy. This used `spack style --fix --all` from #24071 to automatically sort everything in Spack so PR submitters won't have to deal with it.\r\n\r\nThis should go in after #24071, as it assumes we're using `isort`, not `flake8-import-order` to order things. `isort` seems to be more flexible and allows `llnl` mports to be in their own group before `spack` ones, so this seems like a good switch.\r\n\r\nOn the plus side, this does make imports way more readable. I like being able to find them quickly at the tops of files.",
