    "body": "I have a PYTHONSTARTUP file that prints some stuff to screen when I start python. Unlike \"python -c expr\", the command \"spack-python -c expr\" will run the PYTHONSTARTUP file.  I think the implementation is [here](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/develop/lib/spack/spack/cmd/python.py#L50-L54). This behavior causes all the python commands in setup-env.sh to break silently and leaves me unable to \"spack load\" anything.  Brief illustration:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ export PYTHONSTARTUP='/tmp/psu' && rm -f $PYTHONSTARTUP\r\n$ sum=$(spack-python -c 'print 1+1') && echo $sum\r\n2\r\n$ echo \"print 'fubar'\" > $PYTHONSTARTUP\r\n$ sum=$(python -c 'print 1+1') && echo $sum\r\n2\r\n$ sum=$(spack-python -c 'print 1+1') && echo $sum\r\nfubar 2\r\n```",
