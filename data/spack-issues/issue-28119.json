    "body": "This adds a new version to lordec among other things.\r\n\r\nI ran into build errors with this as it pulls in a dep with wget, then I decided I'd pull out the dependency it was fetching into a new package.\r\n\r\ngatb-core vendors a lot of its deps and there's no easy way to make it not do that with cmake, so I figured I'd let that ride. Especially since they're statically compiled into it anyway.",
