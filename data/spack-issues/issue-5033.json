    "body": "If I understood it correctly, the idea of calling decode('utf-8') was to get strings instead of binaries, which Popen.communicate() returns by default in Python3. Unfortunately, this leads to a problem described in  #5032. Another way to tell Popen.communicate() that we want to get strings is to set universal_newlines=True. After this change Executable returns <type 'str'> with Python2 and <class 'str'> with Python3.\r\n\r\nFixes #5032 \r\nFixes #4339 \r\nFixes #3842\r\nCloses #4355",
