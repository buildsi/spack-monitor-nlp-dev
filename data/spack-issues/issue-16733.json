    "body": "Add command to copy an environment file to override a config scope (user, site, system)\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWSC codes want to be very sure that the packages and compilers used are the ones described by the project. Several projects current patch spack through uberenv to limit extra scopes creeping in.  This would remove that hack.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\ngit clone spack\r\ncd spack/repo\r\nbin/spack env activate --without-view --scope=user <path/to/environment/file>\r\n\r\nThen all further commands in the spack repository would honor only that environment file.  This would require piggy back on the on going work of moving the user config out of the users home directory.",
