    "body": "Our importer was always parsing from source (which is considerably slower) because the source size recorded in the `.pyc` file differed from the size of the input file.\r\n\r\n- [x] Override `path_stats` in the prepending importer to fool it into thinking that the source size is the size *with* the prepended code.\r\n\r\nThis speeds up importing all of Spack's packages by about 25% for me (13 seconds vs. 10 seconds).  In conjunction with #13238, this brings `import` time for all 3500 packages down to about 7 seconds (from 13).",
