    "body": "This addresses an issue observed in https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/3227 where extendee_spec on a package was present because the package was not considered concrete (according to the ```._concrete``` property).\r\n\r\n- [ ] I'd like to add a test where a package conditionally extends another package and make sure this fixes the issue\r\n\r\nOriginally Package.is_extension was using Spec._concrete. This replaces the direct access to the cached variable with a call to the property function (since in some cases, e.g. after a copy, _concrete is not set properly).",
