    "body": "If you run Spack in the background, any command you run in the foreground gets echoed.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install ...  # or any long-running command\r\n...\r\n# Hit Ctrl+Z\r\n[1]+  Stopped                 spack install\r\n$ bg\r\n[1]+ spack install &\r\n$ ls\r\nls\r\ncompilers.yaml modules.yaml   packages.yaml  spack.lock     spack.yaml\r\n$ git status\r\ngit status\r\nOn branch develop\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, commands like `ls` and `git status` get echoed. This isn't the case with most other background processes, so it must be a bug in our implementation of #15723.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2-1022-7487706b87\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.3\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-catalina-ivybridge\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
