    "body": "* added updated versions\r\n* edited depends_on() per https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/FactoMineR/index.html\r\n  - not sure why three dependencies were commented out.  They are listed in the packages dependencies.  I will check the spack commit history.\r\n  - EDIT: [from the blame page](https://github.com/spack/spack/blame/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/r-factominer/package.py) seems like those three dependencies were commented out in the original commit.  Perhaps the spack packages were not ready yet at the time?",
