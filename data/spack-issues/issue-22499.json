    "body": "**Superseded by #22588.**\r\n\r\nCurrently, module configurations are inconsistent because modulefiles are generated with the configs for the active environment, but are shared among all environments (and spack outside any environment).\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes that by generating modulefiles separately for Spack inside and outside the environment when an install is done within an environment.\r\n\r\nAdditionally, it adds a feature that the modulefiles for an environment can be configured to be relative to an environment view rather than the underlying prefix. This will not be enabled by default, as it should only be enabled for non-default views constructed with separate projections per-spec.",
