    "body": "ase is supposed to be able to run using\r\n```bash\r\npython3 -m ase\r\n```\r\nor imported into a Python script using\r\n```python\r\nimport ase\r\n```\r\nHowever, these failed with \"No module named ase\" with py-ase from spack. The py-ase package was installing into an egg, but the above commands assume that ase is installed as a \"normal\" Python package.\r\n\r\nBy adding py-setuptools as a dependency at build time, py-ase installs into a normal directory tree. Similar changes have been required in the past on other packages (e.g. #10964, #11961).",
