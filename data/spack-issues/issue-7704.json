    "body": "This PR extends the default spec query handlers, `_headers_default_handler` and `_libs_default_handler`, to support an easy way for packages to define what headers and libraries they provide - just the file names - that information is then used by the default handlers to search for the exact locations, verifying that those files actually exist.\r\n\r\nThe new functionality is described in the handlers' help strings and it is illustrated in the packages `zlib` and `hypre`.\r\n\r\nThis PR supersedes #7261.",
