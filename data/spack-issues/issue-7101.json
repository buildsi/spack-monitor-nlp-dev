    "body": "Hi\r\n\r\nI have multiple python packages installed so I am looking for a way to show which other packages are using these versions of python.\r\n\r\nRight now I am using ```spack uninstall /hash.``` which will show the output.  However, this command seems a bit dangerous.  I looked through the [command index](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/command_index.html) but cannot find the solution.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
