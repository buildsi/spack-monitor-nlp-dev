    "body": "This is my first attempt to package [verrou](https://github.com/edf-hpc/verrou), a floating-point error checker based on Valgrind and Monte Carlo Arithmetic.\r\n\r\nThis tool can be used to run any program, altering the rounding of its floating-point operations (typically randomly) via valgrind instrumentation. If the program is numerically stable, this should not have a significant effect on its result. If the result changes greatly, this is usually the result of a numerical instability.",
