    "body": "Currently, environments can either be concretized fully together or fully separately. This works well for users who create environments for interoperable software and can use `concretization: together`. It does not allow environments with conflicting software to be concretized for maximal interoperability.\r\n\r\nThe primary use-case for this is facilities providing system software. Facilities provide multiple MPI implementations, but all software built against a given MPI ought to be interoperable.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a `concretization` option `together_where_possible`. When this option is used, Spack will concretize specs in the environment separately, but will optimize for minimal differences in overlapping packages.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] tests\r\n- [ ] documentation\r\n- [x] improve optimization criterion for minimizing differences\r\n- [x] minimize appearances of a given virtual\r\n\r\nStretch goal:\r\n- [ ] dynamic optimization without writing to file",
