    "body": "When building other GNOME packages, configure scripts for those packages will search for the GIR files installed by gobject-introspection. In order for these scripts to detect those files successfully, the prefix path for those files must be prepended to `XDG_DATA_DIRS`. This commit adds this operation to the `setup_dependent_environment` method in the `gobject-introspection` Spack package.",
