    "body": "I would like to be able to compile an executable that works across multiple architectures. For example, our cluster contains both sandybridge and haswell nodes. In order to run a program in parallel across both, multiple architecture support must be specified at compile time. Here are some flags that do this:\n\n| Compiler | Flag |\n| --- | --- |\n| Intel | -axCORE-AVX2,AVX |\n| GCC | -march=haswell,sandybridge |\n| PGI | -tp=haswell,sandybridge |\n\nWhat's the best way to do this? I would love to integrate the new better arch support.\n",
