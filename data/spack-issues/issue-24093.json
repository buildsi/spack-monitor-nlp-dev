    "body": "The documentation for subprocess.popen constructor and wait method says the\r\nonly exceptions that will be raised to the parent process happen in cases\r\nwhen the sub-process (which runs \"spack install\" in this case) cannot actually\r\nbe started.  In all of those cases, we want to avoid doing any of the normal\r\npost-processing, and instead just let those exceptions bubble up to be reported\r\nin the job trace.\r\n\r\nAlso fix a bug that required specifying --artifacts-root in order to get the\r\nconcrete environment directory as an artifact.",
