    "body": "* add a subparser\r\n  * to manually specify the spack.yaml from which to\r\n    create the container recipe (-f)\r\n  * to provide a filename to write the recipe to. Useful\r\n    if other output appears on the terminal (e.g. warnings)\r\n\r\nThe commit message describes it. Basically I was a bit annoyed that I couldn't just trigger the recipe building, but had to either `cd` into the environment directory or `spack env activate` the environment in order to containerize. This PR adds two options to the `spack containerize` command:\r\n- `-f specfile` where specfile is a path/to/spack.yaml of the environment you want to containerize\r\n- `-r recipefile` where recipefile is a path/to/recipe where the container recipe should be printed to. This frees up the console to do reporting.\r\n\r\nI think this is a bit of a quality-of-life improvement for the containerize command and makes its behaviour a bit more obvious. The price is a bit more complicated logic in the parsing. On the plus side the error message in case of not finding a `spack.yaml` should be a bit more informative now. I'm not attached to any of the variable names, and maybe `specfile` should be something different. But I'm not up to date with the naming scheme for the whole environment related files, so suggestions are welcome.",
