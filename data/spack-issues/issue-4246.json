    "body": "`ncurses@6.0` builds wide-character libraries by default, whereas `ncurses@5.9` needed a `configure` option to do so. This means `libncurses.so` and friends were not being built by `ncurses@6.0`. Various packages (e.g. `llvm`) depend on `libncurses.so` and do not yet recognise the wide-character library `libncursesw.so`.",
