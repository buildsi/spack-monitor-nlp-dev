    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\n\nInstall a bunch of Intel's packages back-to-back.  E.G.: intel-mpi intel-mkl intel-oneapi-compilers\r\n\r\nSome will succeed, some will fail, some will fail silently and spack will think they succeeded.\r\n\r\nThis seems to be due to the intel installer detecting \"other\" installations of intel packages (within or outside of spack) and doing the wrong thing (failing the install or moving the install location to the prefix of another intel package).\r\n\r\nCan we do something about this?  At a minimum, I'd prefer for spack to detect when the installation failed to put any files into the prefix.\n\n### Information on your system\n\nRedhat-ish 7 x86_64\n\n### Additional information\n\n```\r\n==> intel-ipp: Executing phase: 'configure'\r\n==> intel-ipp: Executing phase: 'install'\r\n==> [2022-02-10-18:17:45.460910] './install.sh' '--silent' 'silent.cfg'\r\nAnother instance of the installation program has been detected. Please quit the \r\nother instance and try again.\r\n```\n\n### General information\n\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
