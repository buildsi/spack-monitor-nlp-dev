    "body": "Maybe someone more familiar with Boost than I am could take a look at this? I've ran into a couple packages now (currently working on OpenFOAM) that depend on `boost+thread`. But they can't find it because they're looking for `-lboost_thread` instead of `-lboost_thread-mt`. Any reason why Boost isn't building `libboost_thread.so`?\n",
