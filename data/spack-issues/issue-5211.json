    "body": "Fixes #5137 \r\n\r\nUsers can specify that extra directories need to be RPATHed for a given compiler in compilers.yaml using the ```extra_rpaths``` entry, but this does not also ensure that the libraries are linked at build time. This modifies the logic so each extra RPATH directory also gets a ```-L``` entry so the directory is available at build time.",
