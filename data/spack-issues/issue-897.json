    "body": "## PR to allow subversion to access http/s repos.\n\nSubversion can interact with http/s repositories if you build it with Apache Serf. Serf requires Scons as its build utility instead of CMake or Autoconf.\n\nI did not make this optional, because it is a fairly common use case for our users, but if y'all think it should be an optional dependency, I will be happy to fix it.\n\n:smile: \n",
