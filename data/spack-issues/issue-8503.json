    "body": "Based on the discussion in #8445, I created this PR for:\r\n\r\n- Making DSO the default build mode for OpenMPI (currently non-DSO is the default)\r\n- Adding a variant for building static library instead of setting the option by default (this is required, as adding --enable-static automatically sets --disable-mca-dso, which leads to a non-DSO build, therefore users should be able to choose if static libraries are enabled or disabled)\r\n- Adding a dependency for lsf, when schedulers=lsf is set\r\n- Adding a dependency for slurm, when schedulers=slurm is set\r\n\r\nI only added dependencies for slurm and lsf, as there is already a slurm package in SPACK, and I have created a non-buildable lsf package. If other users come up with other scheduler packages, then it would make to add more dependencies.",
