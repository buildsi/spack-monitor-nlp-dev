    "body": "Added packages for EasyBuild and all dependencies, i.e.:\r\n\r\n* `vsc-install`\r\n* `vsc-base`\r\n* all three EasyBuild components, i.e.:\r\n  * `easybuild-framework`\r\n  * `easybuild-easyblocks`\r\n  * `easybuild-easyconfigs`\r\n\r\nA couple of open questions I have:\r\n\r\n* there are more strict dependency requirements than what is specified now, but I'm not sure how to specify them:\r\n   * `vsc-base` needs a particular version of `vsc-install`, but the exact requirement depends on the `vsc-base` version, how do I express that? (similar for `easybuild-framework` and `vsc-base`)\r\n   * `easybuild-easyblocks` version `x.y.z` typically requires `easybuild-framework` version `x.y.z`, how do I express that? (similar for `easybuild-easyconfigs`)\r\n\r\nI was a bit surprised that a simply `spack load easybuild` is not sufficient to make the EasyBuild installation done with Spack active in my environment. In particular, `python` and `python2` were still the default system Python.\r\nThis is important for EasyBuild since the main `eb` command is a bash wrapper scripts that calls out to `python` or `python2`, so there's no shebang that Spack can hijack to make sure the `python` command provided by Spack is being used.\r\n`spack activate easybuild` didn't work either, but maybe I wasn't using it correctly...\r\n\r\nThe only way I could use the installation is using `source <(spack module loads --dependencies easybuild)`, is that what I'm supposed to do?",
