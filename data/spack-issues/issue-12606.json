    "body": "When you `spack -e <myenv> install one-package`, in some ways the environment \"forgets\" what else was installed in it.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack -e myenv install\r\nspack -e myenv env loads -r    # Produces a loads file in the env directory with many entries\r\nspack -e myenv install xz\r\nspack -e myenv env loads -r    # Produces very short loads file\r\n```\r\n\r\nLater on, I made it \"remember\" with:\r\n```\r\nspack -e myenv install\r\n```\r\n(which installed nothing, but did go over everything again.  For some reason it re-concretized too, even though I did not ask it to).\r\n\r\nAfter that, I got `spack env loads` files with many extra/repeated entries.",
