    "body": "Fixes a bug I introduced in #28346. For some reason, `python_platlib` isn't defined inside the `libs`/`headers` methods, even though it's defined in the rest of the build phases. Also, if I try to use `inspect.getmodule(self).python_platlib`, Spack ends up using the `_default_libs_handler` instead. @alalazo any idea what's going on here?",
