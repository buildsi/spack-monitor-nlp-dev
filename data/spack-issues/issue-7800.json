    "body": "Fixes #7777 \r\n\r\nIn addition to adding the latest version, this PR also disables the `libssh2` variant by default. See #7777 for backstory. I've tried all of the following things to get `curl+libssh2` to build on macOS but with no luck:\r\n\r\n1. Explicitly specify `--with-libssh2=PATH`\r\n2. Add `pkg-config` dependency\r\n3. Set `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` to the directory containing `libssh2`'s pkg-config files\r\n\r\n@weijianwen you added the `libssh2` variant in #6980. Is this change okay with you? If not, can you figure out how to get `curl+libssh2` to build on macOS? I generally prefer not to enable variants that add dependencies by default.\r\n\r\nFor comparison, MacPorts disables `libssh2` support by default:\r\nhttps://github.com/macports/macports-ports/blob/master/net/curl/Portfile#L52\r\nI believe Homebrew does as well:\r\nhttps://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/curl.rb#L47\r\n\r\nAlso pinging @JohnWGrove @healther @junghans ",
