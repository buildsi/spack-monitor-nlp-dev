    "body": "When I install the OpenMPI package on Stampede (TACC), it doesn't detect that Infiniband is present. When I pass the `+verbs` option, then the configure stage fails, since OpenMPI doesn't correctly auto-detect the location of the libraries.\n\nI can run `which(ibv_devices)` to find the location of this utility (`/opt/ofed`), and pass `--with-verbs=/opt/ofed` to OpenMPI, and this seems to work.\n\nHow should I build this into OpenMPI? Options are:\n- do this in the OpenMPI package, changing how `+verbs` is interpreted, or even changing its default value\n- add a new option `+verbs-autodetect` that does this\n- look at an environment variable `VERBS_DIR` that the caller has to set\n",
