    "body": "This is a change in default behavior for these routines, but better\r\nmatches the mental model for an environment taking precedence over\r\nthe user's default packages.yaml file.\r\n\r\nWhen I'm setting up a new user environment, I'd like to keep a record of what things I've pulled in from the system environment. Both `spack compiler find` and `spack external find` modify things in my user directory, but if I have an environment active then I'd like those changes reflected in my environment.\r\n\r\nThe code to do this was mostly already there. From what I could put together by reading the code and talking to @becker33, `write_section()` for `SingleFileConfig` was untested and many of the internals of `spack.config` were coded before environments were created.  \r\n\r\nThis is a minor cleanup in code quality that none-the-less has a huge impact on the default behavior of `spack external find`, `spack compiler find` and any other routine that relies on `default_modify_scope()` .  The change better reflects the mental model that environments take higher precedence compared to user configurations.\r\n\r\n",
