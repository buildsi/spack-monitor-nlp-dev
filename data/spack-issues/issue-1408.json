    "body": "First draft of package for the Glorious Glasgow Haskell Compiler.\n\nBased on [these instructions](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building).\n\nGather [the prerequisites](https://ghc.haskell.org/trac/ghc/wiki/Building/Preparation/Tools).\n\nBuilding ghc requires a ghc with which to bootstrap.  Rather than drag in RPM's, I grab the official ghc distribution for CentOS6 and a copy of libgmp.3.so (which it needs) and install them into a bootstrap dir.  It seems to work, so....\n\nI'm sure that there is all kinds of room for improvement.  Please pile on!\n\n~~This build takes ~3hours on an 8-core Digital Ocean droplet.~~\nOnce you're past all of the prereqs, the build takes about an hour on an 8-core Digital Ocean droplet.\n\nTODO:\n- need to figure out a better way (currently hardcoded...) to find the libgmp tarball that's in the package dir.\n- need to come up with a way to make this only work on CentOS7, that  be flexible enough to use with other OS's.\n- check through configure output to see what else might be useful, e.g.\n  - depend_on('texlive') to get xetex\n",
