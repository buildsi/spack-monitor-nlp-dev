    "body": "Please correct me if I am wrong with this.\r\nsw4lite was always failing for me, by not being able to pick up the blas / lapack dependencies. \r\nThese are established in 'build_targets'\r\nLooks like build_targets is only called by build, which is locally overloaded in sw4lite, without an explicit call.\r\nThis was actually causing sw4lite to pick up `/usr/lib64/libblas.so` thus bypassing the spack dependencies altogether. \r\n\r\nAdded the call, and it looks like the correct args are now generated and passed through.",
