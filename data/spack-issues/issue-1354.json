    "body": "This fixes the issue that preferred variants do not recognise the  \"-variant\" notation. It also adds some tests to check that compiler, version and variant preferences are applied directly.\n\nThere is a problem that these new tests must be run before the \"cmd.test_compiler_cmd\" tests which remove the gcc compiler from the compiler list.\n",
