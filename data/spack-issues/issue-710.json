Consequently dependents which reference boost libraries like \"-lboost_thread\" may unknowingly reference the single-threaded libs (which lack that suffix).~~\n\n@eschnett I'm curious if you are opposed to the following proposal (since you initially enabled building both the single and multi-threaded libraries and using layout=tagged):\n\n@tgamblin's thought was that the multithreaded libraries could appear under a different prefix \n\nThis would involve updating boost package.py to use layout=system, and to add a switch that chooses either single or multithreaded builds (but not both). A user who wants both could do two separate boost installs.\n\nEdit (4/1) crossed out some faulty reasoning: Erik points out below that layout=tagged is standard; it seems tools like cmake are comfortable with the tagged layout and e.g. RHEL boost package uses tagged layout for boost libs.\n",
