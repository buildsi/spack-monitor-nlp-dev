    "body": "This commit adds Intel Parallel Studio XE 2016 update 4 and 2015 update 6. Since Intel provides only file size and checksum from `cksum`, I comfirmed the downloaded packages have the identical checksums then generate md5 for them.\r\n\r\nhttps://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-parallel-studio-xe-2016-checksums\r\nhttps://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/intel-parallel-studio-xe-2016-checksums\r\n\r\nLimitation:\r\n\r\n* I don't have the installation package for Intel Composer XE. So this commit doesn't include it.\r\n\r\nNeeds feedbacks:\r\n\r\n* It seem that composer in `intel-cluster-studio` package is duplicate with `intel` package. Any plan to merge them?\r\n* The latest package of Intel Parallel Studio XE for each major release -- 2015u6, 2016u4 and 2017u1 -- can be downloaded from Intel website. But other versions cannot be found. Do you think it is a good idea to provide only the latest update above in Spack then retrieve them from Internet during installtion?\r\n\r\n```\r\nwget http://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/irc_nas/8470/parallel_studio_xe_2015_update6.tgz\r\nwget http://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/irc_nas/9781/parallel_studio_xe_2016_update4.tgz\r\nwget http://registrationcenter-download.intel.com/akdlm/irc_nas/10973/parallel_studio_xe_2017_update1.tgz",
