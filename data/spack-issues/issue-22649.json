    "body": "To follow up with https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/22318#issuecomment-803626368, this will add an extra test to ensure that we can run a SpackCommand with global_args for config, meaning that a one off config argument is preserved with a SpackCommand. There was a bug in missing a call to setup_main_options(args) that will now ensure that it works. Thanks to @haampie for the slack discussion about fixing the bug! Note that we decided to add \"command_line\" to the set of scopes for the `mutable_empty_config` fixture, since not having it was probably an oversight.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
