    "body": "This update to the QMCPACK Spack package has a number of updates and bug fixes:\r\n\r\n- QMCPACK now uses the FFTW-API provider. You can only need intel-mkl or fftw, but not both.\r\n- QMCPACK release 6.0 is now supported. This requires detection of a compiler that supports C++14, a newer version of boost, a newer version of CMake, etc.\r\n- Relax dependencies on the +da variant\r\n- Issue conflicts when an incompatible compiler-CUDA combination is chosen.\r\n- Added QMCPACK collective I/O variant.\r\n- Some clean-up of Spack code.\r\n- Update conflicts, in particular qmcpack+qe~mpi variant does not work due to limitations in QE 3.6.0. May be able to fix this later by applying patch to QE.\r\n- Correctly set-up Python environment for QMCPACK data analysis scripts",
