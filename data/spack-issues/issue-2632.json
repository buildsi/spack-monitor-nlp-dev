    "body": "Just noticed this problem:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec h5hut\r\n...\r\n==> Error: Invalid spec: 'hdf5@1.10.0-patch1%gcc@6.1.0+cxx~debug+fortran~mpi+pic+shared+szip~threadsafe arch=linux-centos6-x86_64'. Package hdf5 requires version 1.8:1.8.12, but spec asked for 1.10.0-patch1\r\n```\r\nThis works though:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec h5hut +mpi\r\n```\r\nThis problem was uncovered by #2590, which changed the default to `+mpi`. The problem is with the following version constraints:\r\n```python\r\ndepends_on(\"hdf5 @1.8:\")\r\n# h5hut +mpi uses the obsolete function H5Pset_fapl_mpiposix:\r\ndepends_on(\"hdf5 @:1.8.12\", when=\"+mpi\")\r\n```\r\nMy understanding is that Spack ignores any `when=` dependencies during the first phase of concretization unless they are specified on the command line. Since I didn't specify `+mpi`, it chose the latest version of HDF5. Then, when it evaluated the default of `+mpi`, it found that the latest version of HDF5 does not satisfy `@:1.8.12`. @tgamblin ",
