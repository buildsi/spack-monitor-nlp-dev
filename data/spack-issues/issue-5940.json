    "body": "It has happened to me many times already that a package fails to build simply because the old source code is already staged (from a previous either failed or interrupted build). This happens due to the fact that many packages can't be configured twice, they simply fail to build the second time. It's extremely annoying when I run \"spack install\", go home, and then discover that it failed a few minutes after I left my office.\r\n\r\nI think that \"--restage\" should be the default behavior, and there should be an option \"--no-restage\" or \"--keep-stage\" or something to reuse the old stage.",
