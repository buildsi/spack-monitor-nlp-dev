This looks like a possible recipe bug.\r\n* No maintainer listed for this package.\r\n* I will try modifying the recipe to use the cmake option `-DCMAKE_POSITION_INDEPENDENT_CODE=ON`.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files (didn't upload because the build error seems obvious and not related to build environment.  I can add these later if needed.)\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
