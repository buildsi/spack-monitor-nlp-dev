    "body": "I merged today from develop, and it broke anything that depends_on('py-numpy').  I believe these used to work.  But now I have to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH to point to Numpy (or else `python3 -c numpy` won't find libopenblas.so).\n\nThe most likely reason for this problem is that OpenBLAS builds a shared object (previously I was using ATLAS, I believe with static library).  That has uncovered a latent problem, that Python extensions (eg, those built in py-numpy) do not use RPATH (and thus cannot find libopenblas.so).  Or... maybe this problem with Python libs was introduced in the last two weeks.  Or maybe with \nrefactoring of build_environment on March 21?\n\nSeeking advice...\n\nSee: https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/719\n",
