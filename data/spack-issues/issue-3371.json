    "body": "Updated package description to include small convolutions (machine learning). Cleanup list of offered versions (only the latest update release of each minor version is kept: 1.4.4, 1.5.2, 1.6.6, 1.7.1); introduced master revision (via Git). Slightly more selective installation of the documentation; copy README.md and LICENSE files to documentation folder. Removed outdated build options (make_args); generally stay with LIBXSMM's defaults (general purpose build). Introduced one build variant (\"debug\").",
