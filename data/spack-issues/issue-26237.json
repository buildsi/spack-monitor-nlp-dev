    "body": "Diffutils <3.8 would implicitly assumes that the SIGSTKSZ preprocessor define from glibc is an integer. Unfortunately, [this assumption is violated by glibc >= 2.24](https://sourceware.org/glibc/wiki/Release/2.34#Non-constant_MINSIGSTKSZ_and_SIGSTKSZ). So Linux distributions with a recent version of glibc won't build anything older than diffutils 3.8, which does away with this assumption.",
