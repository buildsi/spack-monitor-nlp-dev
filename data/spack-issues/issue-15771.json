    "body": "Hi, I am very new to spack\r\n\r\nI was trying to get spack to use an already installed mpi installation for abinit.\r\n\r\nI put into my yaml file:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  mvapich2_ib:\r\n    version: [2.3.2]\r\n    paths:\r\n      mvapich2_ib@2.3.2%intel@18.0.1 arch=linux-centos7-haswell: /opt/mvapich2/intel/ib\r\n    buildable: False\r\n  all:\r\n    providers:\r\n      mpi: [ mvapich2_ib, openmpi_ib, intelmpi ]\r\n```\r\nand I edited the provided packages.py file for abinit to make the following change:\r\n```python\r\ndepends_on('mvapich2_ib', when='+mpi')\r\n```\r\nWhen I type:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install abinit\r\n```\r\nI get:\r\n```\r\n==> Error: Package 'mvapich2_ib' not found.\r\n```\r\nI don't know how to debug this.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJerry",
