    "body": "Fixes #15182 \r\nFixes #15684 \r\n\r\nThis change restores the ability to terminate `spack install` using `ctrl-c`*.\r\n\r\nIt also adds support for a `--fail-fast` install option.  Instead of proceeding with a \"best effort\" installation of packages associated with a `spack install`, `spack install --fail-fast` will terminate the installation process upon detection of an install failure (i.e., by the process or another, overlapping install process).\r\n\r\n*Note that I am able to successfully terminate an installation using `develop` by entering `ctrl-c` twice in a row.  This PR reduces the number of times it needs to be entered to one.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n------\r\n- [x] Address PR feedback\r\n- [x] Add option to documentation\r\n\r\n\r\nFollow-On Work\r\n----------------\r\n- If #15415 is merged before this PR, `environment.py` will need to be modified to support `--fast-fail`",
