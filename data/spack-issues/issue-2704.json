    "body": "When a PR adds a version, we don't currently verify that the tarball in question can be downloaded, and checksums as advertised.  Maybe we should add a test to do so.... it would make that verification for every version of every `package.py` changed in a PR.\r\n\r\nIf we cache past tarball downloads in Travis, then it would only have to download newly-added tarballs.\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart Thoughts?\r\n\r\n",
