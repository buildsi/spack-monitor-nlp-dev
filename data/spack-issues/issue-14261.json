    "body": "The external execution of an external shell and python in `_source_single_file()` does not deal well with file paths that contain spaces.\r\n\r\nFilenames and their arguments should be properly quoted when being passed to the shell for sourcing, and the test should verify that spaces and awkward characters in the path or arguments should be handled.\r\n\r\nNote that there is currently no use of the enclosing function (`environment_after_sourcing_files()`) in Spack core or builtin recipes. If there is no use case, perhaps this code could be removed?",
