    "body": "Modifications:\r\n- [x] Change `defaults/config.yaml`\r\n- [x] Add a fix for bootstrapping patchelf from sources if `compilers.yaml` is empty\r\n- [x] Make `SPACK_TEST_SOLVER=clingo` the default for unit-tests\r\n- [x] Fix package failures in the e4s pipeline\r\n\r\nCaveats:\r\n1. CentOS 6 still uses the original concretizer as it can't connect to the buildcache due to issues with `ssl` (bootstrapping from sources requires a C++14 capable compiler)\r\n1. I had to update the image tag for GitlabCI in e699f14. ~I did this since Radiuss is using that image and is already working with clingo, but it's not clear to me what are the differences between the two tags, so asked for @scottwittenburg review of that change.~ Thanks for the review @scottwittenburg \r\n1. libtool v2.4.2 has been deprecated and other packages received some update",
