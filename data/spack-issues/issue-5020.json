    "body": "Fixes #4112\r\n\r\nThis commit extends the support of the `AutotoolsPackage` methods `with_or_without` and `enable_or_disable` to bool-valued variants. It also defines for those function a convenience short-cut if the\r\nactivation parameter is the prefix of a spec (like in `--with-{pkg}={prefix}`).\r\n\r\nI added a couple of examples to show how the packages would look like once ported.",
