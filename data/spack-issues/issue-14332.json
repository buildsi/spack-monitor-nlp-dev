    "body": "This PR reworks the texlive package so that it installs from versioned\r\nsource distibution files. This is preferred over installing the binary\r\npackage for several reasons. For the binary installation:\r\n\r\n1. Each component is downloaded, so can not use a spack mirror.\r\n2. Changes in components over time are not reflected in spack hash.\r\n3. Some of the binaries do not run due to glibc issues, depending on OS.\r\n\r\nThis PR keeps the binary installation as an option but it should be\r\nconsidered deprecated, and probably rewmoved at some point.\r\n\r\nThis PR depends on zziplib from PR #14318.",
