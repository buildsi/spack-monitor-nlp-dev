    "body": "fixes #26866\r\n\r\nThis semantics fits with the way Spack currently treats providers of virtual dependencies. It needs to be revisited when #15569 is reworked with a new syntax.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] Ensure that if a package _can_ be a provider, then _it is_ a provider\r\n- [x] Add a unit test to prevent regression",
