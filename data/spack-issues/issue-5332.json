    "body": "Fixes #5281.\r\n@obreitwi @ax3l @alalazo @scheibelp @healther \r\n\r\n- [x] Fixes bugs where concretization would fail due to an erroneously cached\r\n  _concrete attribute.\r\n\r\n- [x] Ripped out a bunch of code in spec.py that isn't needed/valid anymore:\r\n  - The various concrete() methods on different types of Specs would\r\n    attempt to statically compute whether the Spec was concrete.\r\n  - This dates back to when DAGs were simpler and there were no optional\r\n    dependencies.  It's actually NOT possible to compute statically\r\n    whether a Spec is concrete now.  The ONLY way you know is if it goes\r\n    through concretization and is marked concrete once that completes.\r\n  - This commit removes all simple concreteness checks and relies only on\r\n    the _concrete attribute.  This should make thinking about\r\n    concreteness simpler.\r\n\r\n- [x] Fixed a couple places where Specs need to be marked concrete explicitly.\r\n  - Specs read from files and Specs that are destructively copied from\r\n    concrete Specs now need to be marked concrete explicitly.\r\n  - These spots may previously have \"worked\", but they were brittle and\r\n    should be explcitly marked anyway.\r\n\r\n- [x] Fixed bug - `_dup()` and `_dup_deps()` that would lose cached \r\n   concreteness of dependencies.\r\n",
