    "body": "### Summary\n\nI propose to add macOS machines to the suite of CI pipelines that test package installs.\n\n### Rationale\n\nI often find packages don\u2019t build on macOS (most recently `paraview` and its dependencies, which triggered this issue). This is a frustrating experience that can discourage new users. The main target of Spack is Linux HPC systems, but I believe users often try installing packages on their local machine as well (I do), in particular when testing Spack for the first time, and macOS is very widespread on personal machines.\n\n### Description\n\nBuilds on macOS with AppleClang work more often than LLVM clang and GCC. I propose a build matrix with all three compilers.\n\n### Additional information\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, GitHub Actions offers macOS virtual machines.\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
