    "body": "Summary:\r\n* Update HDF5 constraints, cartesian product is no longer required with clingo.\r\n* Removed HDF5 1.10 constraint in favor of handling building with later versions of HDF5 with `H5_USE_110_API` option.\r\n\r\nPurpose:\r\n* The ecp-data-vis-sdk requires HDF5 v1.12. This will allow conduit, and then ascent, to build in that environment without requiring `ascent@develop` in the spec. This is blocking #28693 and #28712 .\r\n\r\n@cyrush ",
