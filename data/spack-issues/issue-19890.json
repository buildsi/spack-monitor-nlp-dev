    "body": "As of https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/18205 (merged today November 12), all packages must be pickle-able to be installed by Spack.\r\n\r\nThis adds a test to check that each package can be pickled. If any package fails to pickle, the test keeps going and collects the names of all failed packages; it then takes the first one that failed and attempts to re-pickle it, generating the full stacktrace for the failed pickle attempt.",
