    "body": "- Frequently, the documentation build will fail mysteriously in some spack command.\r\n\r\n- The cause is some new bug introduced by the PR, but this is not apparent because the unit tests haven't run and the doc tests aren't targeted at code bugs.\r\n\r\n- Users end up puzzled by doc failures when they're really code failures.\r\n\r\n- Move the doc tests parallel with the code tests, so that we can more easily see bugs like this.",
