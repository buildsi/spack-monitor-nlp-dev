If I manually use tar -xf to extract the archive there are no problems. Similarly, if I manually add /path/to/xz/lib to LD_LIBRARY_PATH inside compilers.yaml spack extracts the archive with no problem.\r\n\r\nThis issue seems similar to https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/315 and the only fix that I have been able to find is to switch to the gz format (https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/316).  Is it possible to submit a PR for this and switch the archive type to gz for the gettext package?",
