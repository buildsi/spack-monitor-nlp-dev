    "body": "Fixes #25618 \r\nFixes #25093 \r\n\r\nThis PR has been tested on MacOS with Python 3.8.2 and 2.7.16.\r\n\r\n~The initial commit only does the equivalent of a `spack load` on the package itself, not any dependencies.~\r\n\r\n~It also loads the settings for each package before testing.  It does not load the settings for all packages being tested before testing any.  Why you may ask?  Because you may want to test multiple versions of a package with a single `spack test run` and some stand-alone tests confirm that they are running an executable associated with the installation being tested.  Such tests will fail if the paths for all specs are each prepended in advance.~",
