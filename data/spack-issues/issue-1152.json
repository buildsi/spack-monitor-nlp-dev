It contains these lines:\n\n``` Python\n    depends_on('hdf5@1.8.4:+mpi', when='+mpi')\n    depends_on('hdf5@1.8.4:~mpi', when='~mpi')\n    depends_on('mpi', when='+mpi')\n```\n\nThe first two of these should probably read instead\n\n``` Python\n    depends_on('hdf5@1.8.4:')\n    depends_on('hdf5+mpi', when='+mpi')\n```\n\nThis would allow using a plain `h5py` (which is `h5py~mpi`) with a `hdf5+mpi`. I don't think there is a reason to disallow this.\n",
