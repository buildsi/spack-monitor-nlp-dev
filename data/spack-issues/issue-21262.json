    "body": "Currently, Spack can fail for a valid spec if the spec is constructed from overlapping, but not conflicting, concrete specs via the hash.\r\n\r\nFor example, if `abcdef` and `ghijkl` are the hashes of specs that both depend on `zlib/mnopqr`, then `foo ^/abcdef ^/ghijkl` will fail to construct a spec, with the error message \"Cannot depend on zlib... twice\".\r\n\r\nThis PR changes this behavior to check whether the specs are identical before failing.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, `foo ^/abcdef ^/ghijkl` will concretize.\r\n\r\nAs a side-effect, so will `foo ^zlib ^zlib` and other specs that are redundant on their dependencies.",
