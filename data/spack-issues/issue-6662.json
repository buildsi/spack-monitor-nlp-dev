    "body": "In the absence of some kind of opengl package, VTK and ParaView can end up finding the Mesa opengl implementation when `+qt` is enabled, which results in greatly reduced rendering performance (especially if llvmpipe is not used).  The intent of this PR is to add a package which is not intended to be built, but is rather just a placeholder for system-installed opengl implementation (usually provided by drivers specific to graphics hardware).",
