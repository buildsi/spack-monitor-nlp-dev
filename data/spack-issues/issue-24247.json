    "body": "In short, this extends the changes in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/24163 to unit tests.\r\n\r\nOn some Mac OS systems, the `git --version` output is:\r\n\r\n```\r\ngit version 2.20.1 (Apple Git-117)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe `(Apple Git-117)` part is new, and Spack doesn't parse it properly. This was causing all git fetches to fail on Mac OS. The PR updates the version extraction regex and consolidates the version parsing logic across tests and `GitFetchStrategy`.",
