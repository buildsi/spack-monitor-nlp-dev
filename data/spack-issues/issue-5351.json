    "body": "It looks like #3057 introduced a bug in `setup-env.sh`.  On my mac when I source `setup-env.sh`, I now get:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nbasename: invalid option -- 'b'\r\nTry 'basename --help' for more information.\r\nWARNING: A method for managing modules does not currently exist.\r\n\r\nTo resolve this you may either:\r\n1. Allow spack to handle this by running 'spack bootstrap'\r\n   and sourcing this script again.\r\n2. Install and activate a supported module managment engine manually\r\n   Supported engines include: environment-modules and lmod\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think the `basename: invalid option -- 'b'` part is a bug, and the rest is too noisy.\r\n\r\nYou can use Spack without environment modules, and once we introduce environment support, we won't *require* modules for most users on laptops/workstations.  I think `setup-env.sh` should be mostly quiet, and the warnings above should be moved to `spack load`, `spack unload`, etc., so that they trigger when you first try to load a module, not when you start your shell.\r\n\r\n@krafczyk @scheibelp @mamelara @alalazo : opinions?",
