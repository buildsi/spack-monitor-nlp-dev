    "body": "extend `url` to be a list of urls as opposed to a single one.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\noftentimes fetching fails due to websites being down:\r\n```\r\n==> Fetching from https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/texinfo/texinfo-6.5.tar.gz failed.\r\n==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for texinfo-6.5-jfsqfa7c3igtjeirfpf3oavvmkw5v5ir\r\n```\r\na simple hack is to edit the package to use an alternative source:\r\n```\r\nurl      = \"https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-6.5.tar.gz\"\r\n```\r\nA new user might not know what to do and what to edit, so it would be good to minimize such hacks.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nNot sure how intrusive/diffucult is it, but Spack could support things like\r\n```\r\nurl    = [\"https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/texinfo/texinfo-6.5.tar.gz\", \"https://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/texinfo/texinfo-6.5.tar.gz\", ....]\r\n```\r\n\r\nand try to use the another source in the list if fetching failed for the current one.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nSame issue has been raised in [Google forum](https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/spack/MW67IXrVA2w) and also in Slack recently.",
