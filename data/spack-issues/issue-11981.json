    "body": "Alternative to #11797 and #7862.\r\n\r\nThis \"minimalist\" change allows for the definition of no-source -- or bundle -- packages that contain no source (or code) of their own to install; rather, they simply encapsulate a set of code/software dependencies.  The base class to use is `BundlePackage`.  (Thanks to Elizabeth (citibeth) for the name.)\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Add template creation of the example (i.e., `nosource`) bundle package\r\n- [x] Raise exception if no-source package has a version checksum\r\n- [x] Move version checks into directives\r\n- [x] Raise custom error in ``fetch_strategy.for_package_version`` if a no-source package\r\n- [x] Rename ``is_code_pkg`` to something less \"clunky\"\r\n- [x] ``info`` command should not display a URL for no-source packages\r\n- [x] Raise custom exception if attempt `do_fetch`~~, `do_stage`, `do_patch`~~ for no-source package\r\n- [x] Raise exception if no-source package specified with source directives \r\n- [x] Require template option to build a `BundlePackage` (i.e., do not default to it if a URL is not provided)\r\n- [x] Provide clearer exception message for new version checksum check\r\n- [x] Allow no-source packages to run `do_stage`, `do_patch`, and `do_install`\r\n- [x] Allow no-source packages to check for unfinished installs\r\n- [x] Allow no-source installs to fork the build (to at least run post-install hooks)\r\n- [x] Separate clearing directive functions fixture from the mock bundle package fixture\r\n- [x] Add special failure message if an invalid (as in empty or spaces) package name provided to `create`\r\n- [x] Clarify the `NoFetchStageError` message\r\n- [x] Restore/adjust various comments in `package.py`\r\n- [x] Do not print \"Installation Phases:\" in `spack info` if there are none.\r\n- [x] Revise package lifecycle comment changes\r\n- [x] Remove rationale for use of `pkg.has_code` property (versus automation)\r\n- [x] Clarify that `NoVersion*` test/mock package comments wrt the fact they should be rejected\r\n- [x] Clarify why the Octave build system guesser is a special case in the associated test comments",
