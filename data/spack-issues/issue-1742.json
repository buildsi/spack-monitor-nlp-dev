    "body": "Take a look at #1741.\n\nThis PR doesn't solve the issue, but it does prevent users from running into problems when running `run-doc-tests` if their build directory isn't already clean.\n\nBy the way, I set up `run-doc-tests` to run `make clean` after it finishes. @citibeth pointed out that this makes it difficult to view the resulting HTML files. Should I remove this? The only problems this would cause would be wasted storage space (who cares) and it would cause problems if you try to go to the directory and run `make` without running `make clean` first. I don't think it would matter as far as Travis CI is concerned.\n",
