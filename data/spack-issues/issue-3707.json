    "body": "I've been building the *shiny-server* package in a spack tree located at a convenient location (that happens to have a short path).\r\n\r\nWhen I updated my Jenkins build to include *shiny-server*, the job failed while building *shiny-server* with this error (while cleaning up in part of the shiny server's built in node server):\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake[4]: execvp: printf: Argument list too long\r\n```\r\n\r\nI scratched my head a bit and remembered that I had configured Spack to always stage \"in-tree\", like so:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  # The build stage can be purged with `spack purge --stage`.\r\n  build_stage:\r\n    - $spack/var/spack/stage\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt occurred to me that `/tmp` is a much shorter path than where Jenkins' workspace lives and so I changed it (back to) to this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n  # The build stage can be purged with `spack purge --stage`.\r\n  build_stage:\r\n    - $tempdir\r\n    - $spack/var/spack/stage\r\n```\r\n\r\nThat build is running, but I noticed (and now remember) that Spack is still building in `.../var/spack/stage/yada/yada/yada` but that that is a link to `/tmp/username/spack-stage`.\r\n\r\nI predict that when the job tries to build the shiny-server package it's going to blow up again.\r\n\r\n**Is there any way to avoid the symlink and simply use the specified directory path?**\r\n",
