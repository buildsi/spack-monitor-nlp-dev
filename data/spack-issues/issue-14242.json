    "body": "The latest version of node.js seems to support Python 3 now! It looks like there has been experimental support for quite some time, so I'm not sure what version was the first to add support. I tried both 12.14.0 and 13.5.0 and the former had some \"ImportError: no module named 'site'\" style errors, while 13.5.0 works fine. Now I just have to get `npm` working...\r\n\r\nSuccessfully builds on macOS 10.15.2 with Clang 11.0.0 and Python 3.7.4.",
