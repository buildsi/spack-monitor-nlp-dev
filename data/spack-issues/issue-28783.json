    "body": "fixes #28749 \r\n\r\nBefore this PR the construction of a spec list for software stacks was based on string concatenation rather than constraint merging. This may cause issues like #28749 if a line in the matrix contains constrains on both the root spec and a dependency. This PR fixes the issue by using `Spec.constrain` instead of string concatenation to construct the spec list.\r\n\r\nNested matrices and temporarily converted back to string to allow for a sigil to be applied in front of them when they are expanded as `$^` or as `$%`.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a regression test based on #28749\r\n- [x] Fix a bug in `Spec.constrain` that wasn't adding a name or a namespace to an anonymous spec if constrained with a named spec\r\n- [x] Use `Spec.constrain` to merge the constraints for spec matrices",
