    "body": "We found some other package need include `SSE2NEON.h` just as racon pacakge( https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/14529 )\r\nAnd it's hard for each package by using `SSE2NEON.h` as a patch file (almost 2800+ lines).\r\nSo, I want to add a sse2neon pacakge without any compile flow and just supporting a `SSE2NEON.h` file. Then some other packages can depends_on that package.\r\nIs that OK?\r\n\r\nPS: [sse2neon repo](https://github.com/jratcliff63367/sse2neon)",
