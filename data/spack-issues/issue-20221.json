    "body": "We would like to determine whether z3 can be used in the place of clingo for the new concretizer implemented in #19501.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\n- z3 is more widely used, and may be more performant (this needs to be verified).\r\n- Initially, we thought z3 would be easier to bootstrap. But as per the discussion in #20123 and the changes in #20159, it seems like clingo will also bootstrap successfully. But we need to verify that either will build and run on all of spack's supported platforms.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement a z3 solver which produces similar output to #19501 (currently in https://github.com/spack/spack/tree/z3-concretizer).\r\n- [ ] **If we can validate in CI that clingo builds in a 2.6, C++11-only environment, we can close this issue.**",
