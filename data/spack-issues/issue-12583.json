    "body": "In working towards alerting package maintainers about issues relating to their packages, we can have a triage team look at new non-feature issues to identify the spack packages, etc.\r\n\r\nThe ad-hoc way in which new issues are currently triaged is by checking for issues with no comments and which have no label assigned.\r\n\r\nA better way than looking at the number of comments would be using the existing \"triage\" label per this slack discussion:\r\nhttps://spackpm.slack.com/archives/C5VL7V81G/p1566834844172000\r\n...and the issue templates can additionally set the \"triage\" label by default to non-feature issues.\r\n\r\nWe might also consider renaming \"triage\" to \"needs-triage\" to more clearly state the intention of the label as explained in the discussion linked.\r\n\r\nPR incoming.",
