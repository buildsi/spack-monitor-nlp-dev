    "body": "It looks like the official FTP server (ftp://ftp.unidata.ucar.edu/pub/netcdf) provides only recent versions of the packages and according to the [official page](https://www.unidata.ucar.edu/downloads/netcdf/) older versions should be downloaded from GitHub. The [fallback solution](https://www.gfd-dennou.org/arch/netcdf/unidata-mirror/) that we used doesn't offer old versions anymore too. Hence, it's time to finally switch to GitHub. Unfortunately, the tarballs that are available there have slightly different contents, which is why we need to update the checksums too. I am going to show the difference in the following comments.\r\n\r\nCloses #15752",
