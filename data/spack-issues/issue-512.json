When using a non-mpi compiler, you need to add the mpi library and include file information to the configure line:\n\n  --with-MPI-include=DIR\n  --with-MPI-libs=LIBS\n  --with-MPI-lib-dirs=DIRS\n\nI'm not exactly sure how you are passing the openmpi path information to hypre.  If it's through a CFLAGS environment variable, then that might appear after the MPI stuff.\n\nHope this helps.  Let me know.\n\nLog file of erroneous build:\n\n[hypre-package.txt](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/163873/hypre-package.txt)\n[log.txt](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/163870/log.txt)\n[environ.txt](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/163871/environ.txt)\n",
