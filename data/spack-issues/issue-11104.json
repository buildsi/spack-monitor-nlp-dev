    "body": "The basemap package was failing to import. This is because basemap installed an __init__.py in its mpl_toolkits namespace directory. Per https://packaging.python.org/guides/packaging-namespace-packages/:\r\n\r\n> It is extremely important that every distribution that uses the namespace package omits the __init__.py or uses a pkgutil-style __init__.py. If any distribution does not, it will cause the namespace logic to fail and the other sub-packages will not be importable.\r\n\r\nThis has been reported to the basemap project as https://github.com/matplotlib/basemap/issues/456.\r\n\r\nThis PR should supercede #10590.",
