    "body": "I have installed some python packages (i.e., py-numpy) via spack stacks and have defined a projection (all via spack.yaml). After doing a `spack install` the packages are appropriately installed and a projection is generated. However, since the python packages have not been activated yet, I cannot load them. If I `spack activate py-numpy`then I can import it when I use the actual python binary in spack/opt/spack/<arch>/<compiler>/python<version+hash>/bin/python. However, if I run the python binary that is linked into the projection, the import will fail with \"ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'numpy'\". I believe this is because the activation happened after the projection was created and thus is not visiable via the projection. Should we consider a way to specify activation via the spack.yaml specification or activate packages by default? Even then, we need to make sure the activated packages are appropriately added to the projection, either in the python projection's site-packages directory or by modifying the sys.path to look in the actual installation's site-packages directory instead of the projection's directory.\r\n\r\nI don't recall if a similar issue has been reported before, so feel free to point me to other discussions if they exist.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
