    "body": "So far most edits are organization. One section was removed. \r\n\r\n* Remove the section \"What happens at subscript time?\" - this is overly-detailed for the tutorial (perhaps it should move somewhere @alalazo do you have a thought on where?)\r\n* Move the sections \"Extra query parameters\" and \"Attach attributes to other packages\" into the section group \"Other Packaging Topics\". The goal was to organize so that the following sections (considered most interesting) come first:\r\n  * A motivating example (`cmake_args` using `.libs` and implementation of `netlib-lapack.lapack_libs`)\r\n  * Single package providing multiple virtual specs\r\n  * Set environment variables in dependent packages at build-time (updated section title)\r\n  * Set environment variables in your own package (updated section title)\r\n* Updated section title \"Set environment variables in your own package\" to start with `qt` as an example: it sets the build environment and the run environment. Include `elpa` example after that.\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n- [x] The section \"Set environment variables in dependent packages at build-time\" was reordered before \"Set environment variables in your own package\" but I still need to update the introductions\r\n- [x] additional title rewording (e.g. \"Package's build environment\")\r\n- [x] reword the section \"Spec's build interface\"\r\n",
