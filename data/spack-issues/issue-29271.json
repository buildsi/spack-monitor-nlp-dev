I am assuming this works for the above application. \r\n\r\nThe documentation is for spack v0.17.1\n\n### Rationale\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
