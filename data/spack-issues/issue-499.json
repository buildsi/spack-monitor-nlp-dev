    "body": "- Allows URLs to be fetched without expanding them, e.g. for self-extracting binaries or other commercial packaging methods.  e.g.:\n  \n  ``` python\n      version('1.0', 'abcdefg1234567', url='http://example.com/self-extracting-installer',\n              expand=False)\n  ```\n- Fixed composite stage so that you can still refer to `self.stage.archive_file` within a package.  Documented this feature.\n- Made `spack_cc`, `spack_cxx`, `spack_fc`, `spack_f77` variables available from within builds (easy access to paths to Spack's compiler wrappers).\n  - used to be simpler when we only allowed the `cc`, `cxx`, etc. names, but more important now that we made the compiler wrappers use more appropriate names to support libtool (#255)\n",
