    "body": "fixes #12527\r\n\r\n- [x] Mention that specs  can be uninstalled by hash also in the help message\r\n- [x] Reference `spack gc` in case people are looking for ways to clean the store from build time dependencies.\r\n- [x] Use \"spec\" instead of \"package\" to avoid ambiguity in the error message.\r\n\r\nThe result is the following:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack uninstall -h\r\nusage: spack uninstall [-hfRya] ...\r\n\r\nremove installed packages\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  installed_specs   one or more installed package specs\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help        show this help message and exit\r\n  -f, --force       remove regardless of whether other packages or environments depend on this one\r\n  -R, --dependents  also uninstall any packages that depend on the ones given via command line\r\n  -y, --yes-to-all  assume \"yes\" is the answer to every confirmation request\r\n  -a, --all         remove ALL installed packages that match each supplied spec\r\n\r\nSpecs to be uninstalled are specified using the spec syntax (`spack help --spec`) and can be identified by their hashes. To remove packages that are needed only at build time and were not explicitly installed see `spack gc -h`.\r\n\r\nWhen using the --all option ALL packages matching the supplied specs will be uninstalled. For instance, `spack uninstall --all libelf` uninstalls all the versions of `libelf` currently present in Spack's store. If no spec is supplied, all installed packages will be uninstalled. If used in an environment, all packages in the environment will be uninstalled.\r\n```",
