    "body": "### Summary\n\nSetup is this: The admin of our test cluster shares his spack environment, so that users can find, inspect and load installed packages. This is also useful because I as a user don't have to care about compilers.\r\n\r\nBut as soon as I define `install_tree` (to point a directory where I have write access) in my `~/.spack/config.yml` I don't find any of the system packages anymore. I can install my own stuff based on his package definitions, but his installations are gone. \r\n\r\nI am aware of the upstream setting to chain spack installations. But in the above setup I don't have my own spack installation running and I would like to avoid that.\r\n\r\nI know that there are configuration scopes and I clearly set mine the in the users scope whereas the admin used a global scope (I think). So my question is: \r\n- Why does my user config overwrites a more global configuration?\r\n- Is there a proper configuration for that scenario?\r\n- Is using `upstream` for the already known system installation a proper workaround?\r\n- Do I misuse spack in this kind of _shared_ mode?\r\n\r\nThis is defo not a normal feature request, but it's also not a bug report or a build problem. Sorry, if I chose the wrong place\n\n### Rationale\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nspack verson is 0.17.1\r\n\r\nI will ask around in slack, but keep the description here. sry for the entropy\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
