    "body": "PETSc requires Python for building.\n\nI have a case where an HPC system has a very old default Python version, too old for Spack. So I load a module for Python, which makes Spack work. This module relies on LD_LIBRARY_PATH.\n\nWhen building PETSc, Spack unsets LD_LIBRARY_PATH, breaking the Python that PETSc finds.\n\nExplicitly requiring Python for PETSc makes building PETSc work.\n",
