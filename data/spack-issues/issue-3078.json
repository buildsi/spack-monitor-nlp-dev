    "body": "Reverts LLNL/spack#2920\r\n\r\nReverting this while I implement a better fix.  This fix doesn't work when reading in `spec`s for which there is no longer a package available.\r\n\r\nPer #2920, the module logic should be aware of packages that don't exist, and spec copying logic should preserve concreteness so we don't have to do this fix.  I think the latter is what caused the initial bug.\r\n",
