    "body": "When I try to import `py-fusepy`, it complains that it can't find `libfuse`. When I add a dependency on `libfuse`, it tells me that `libfuse` only supports Linux and that I need `macFUSE` instead. So I added a `macfuse` package that requires users to manually install a DMG, then added a virtual dependency that depends on the OS. Also updated existing packages that depend on `libfuse`.",
