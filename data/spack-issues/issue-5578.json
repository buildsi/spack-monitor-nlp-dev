    "body": "We have a couple students currently working for our team creating spack packages, and after the weekend started getting errors for packages that have a patch somewhere in the dependency chain.  Packages without patches involved don't seem to have a problem.\r\n\r\nErrors end with:\r\n`have the same SHA-1 prefix!`\r\nI see two other issues opened today that look very similar: #5565 and #5574 \r\n\r\nThe issue was just reported to me a few minutes ago, so I haven't dug in deeply yet, but I suspect this was a bug introduced by https://github.com/LLNL/spack/commit/4f8c7d57eb3839ea866a9fbfb55f9a44af99d6c0.\r\n\r\nA quick guess is that the new patch hash prefixes are colliding with the hashes for existing packages.",
