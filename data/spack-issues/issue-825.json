    "body": "The changes in this pull request make the following changes to the Scotch package:\n- Fix a bug that was causing shared library usage to fail when linking with another application.\n- Update the repository URL to allow for more general version downloading.\n- Add installation support for version 5.1.10b.\n- Clean up the installation file to make it a bit easier to follow and modify.\n\nI've verified that the `+mpi` and `+shared` installation variants for both versions 6.0.3 and 5.1.10b compile and can be linked with external code on CHAOS when compiling with gcc@4.7.2.\n\nSidebar Below:\n\nAt first glance, it looks like I made some heavy modifications to this package, but really the majority of the changes consist of rearrangements of existing code segments.  I decided to change the code in this way to make it (what I believe to be) easier to read.  Eliminating a lot of the one-off function calls makes it easier for me to see exactly what the `Scotch.patch` function is doing.  If others prefer the previous implementation, I have no objections to reverting it; I just thought I'd try to improve the package a bit while I was making some changes.\n",
