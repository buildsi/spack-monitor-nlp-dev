    "body": "This is intended to fix #14102, only relevant to macOS with Python=3.8.\r\n\r\nPython 3.8 in macOS switches to the `spawn` start method in multiprocessing as [default](https://docs.python.org/3/library/multiprocessing.html#contexts-and-start-methods), so the resources of the parent process may not be inherited by the child process. Forcing \"fork\" start might not be a permanent solution (see [here](https://bugs.python.org/issue33725)), but at least get things working on macOS for now.\r\n\r\nI came across a similar issue in a different setting, which was reported [here](https://github.com/dfm/emcee/issues/335).",
