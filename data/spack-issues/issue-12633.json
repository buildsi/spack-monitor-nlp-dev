    "body": "*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*\r\nThere should be a check that the `install_tree` directory is not a subdirectory of `build_stage` in config.yaml.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, by typing:\r\n`spack clean`\r\n\r\nAll your packages are blown away.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\n*Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it!*\r\n\r\nIt was an oversight on my part, but I set-up `config.yaml` as follows:\r\n[naromero@naromero-desktop ~]$ more ~/.spack/config.yaml\r\n'''\r\nconfig:\r\n    build_jobs: 12\r\n    install_tree: /sandbox/$user/opt/spack\r\n    build_stage:\r\n    - /sandbox/$user\r\n'''\r\n\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n*Describe the solution you'd like and the alternatives you have considered.*\r\n\r\nIf Spack is to be used in a production environment, there should be some sanity check or at least a warning to prevent this.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n*Add any other context about the feature request here.*\r\n\r\n@becker33 You may find this funny. I had a cron job running for weeks tests that the two Spack packages that I maintain build properly. At some point, I introduced `spack clean` and stuff was disappearing every day. I thought I was going insane.\r\n\r\nFor sure, consider this low priority. I submit a github issue to make sure the developers are aware that this could happen accidentally and can be a cause for potential confusion.\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!",
