Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ module load cuda/10.2.89\r\n$ spack external find cuda --not-buildable\r\n$ module load cuda/10.1.243\r\n$ spack install py-torchvision^py-torch+cuda\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-807-44f244ace\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-power9le\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart\r\n\r\nProblem occurs in `py-torchvision` using `CUDAExtension`, which in turn uses this code in the `py-torch` package, in this code here: https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/_modules/torch/utils/cpp_extension.html#CUDAExtension in `_find_cuda_home`\r\n\r\nFix should be to set the environment variable `CUDA_HOME` during build.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
