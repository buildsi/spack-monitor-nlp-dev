    "body": "Some packages don't depend on which compiler you used to compile them (or they don't involve a compiler at all).  For example... I installed gcc@4.9.3.  The GCC bootstrap process compiles the compiler with itself, so it doesn't matter what compiler you started off with.\n\nHowever... I'm getting it installed in a directory like this:\n    ~spack/linux-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/gcc-4.9.3-layphctulnk3omsbjpzftqv6dlxpfe3d/bin/gcc\n\nHow do we get Spack to NOT put gcc-4.8.5 in the identifier or hash?\n",
