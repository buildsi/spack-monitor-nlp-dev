    "body": "I threw this together working on #1562, and thought I'd just get it merged.\n\nSpack ships with its own `PyYAML` module in `lib/spack/external/yaml`, but it doesn't use the C `libyaml` because we don't want to require compiling anything -- Spack _must_ run out of the box.  \n\ncYAML is pretty fast, though, and with things like #1015 and #1535 the main bottleneck to operations like `spack find` is YAML parsing.  \n\nThis patch makes Spack use an already-installed PyYAML and the `CParser` and `CLoader` from `libyaml` if they're available.  It makes a `spack find` on @adamjstewart's 400+ installed packages from #1562 run **3x faster** (1s vs 3s) on my laptop.\n\n@alalazo @davydden @adamjstewart @citibeth \n",
