That currently fails to build for me because it's missing xxd.\r\n\r\nIt would be weird to add vim as a build dependency to hsa-rocr-dev, so I've made xxd-standalone a standalone provider for xxd, this is how it's done on in debian and the aur too.\r\n\r\n- Add xxd standalone package\r\n- Sort the providers by package name\r\n- Add xxd providers\r\n- Add xxd as a build tool for hsa-rocr-dev\r\n\r\n",
