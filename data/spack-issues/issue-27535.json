    "body": "Modified the rocm recipes to support the rocm-4.5.0 release.\r\n1. llvm-amdgpu will now build in 2 stages . build the libcxx,libcxxabi using the just built clang. I tried to invoke the LLVM_ENABLE_RUNTIMES but doing so i did not get the build to pass. my changes will try to achieve the same thing.\r\n2. hip - starting 4.5.0 , hip is cloning the rocm-opencl-runtime ,hip-rocclr, hipamd( https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/hipamd)   For release version  the usual build procedure is  cmake -DHIP_COMMON_DIR=\"$HIP_DIR\" -DAMD_OPENCL_PATH=$OPENCL_DIR -DROCCLR_PATH=$ROCCLR_DIR -DCMAKE_PREFIX_PATH=\"/opt/rocm/\" -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=</where/to/install/hip> .\r\n I made some of the changes to reflect this approach . \r\n3. rocclr (hip-rocclr) - starting with rocm-4.5.0 , there is no cmake install() for this and hip is using it differently . i still have few recipes which currently refer to the header files of rocclr. rocm-opencl and few others which depend on rocm-opencl that would require changes which are not part of this PR\r\n4. rocrand - i see some cleanup for this recipe that is pending for review .(PR 26919 ) . leveraged some of those changes.\r\n5. rocblas - starting with rocm-4.3.0 , rocm-tensile was supporting the passing of multiple gpu architectures. The current rocblas was having an issue when we tried to do spack install rocblas@4.0.0 or spack install rocblas@4.0.0 tensile_architecture=gfx906 . This is corrected with in the PR\r\n6. All rocm recipes except for rocm-openmp-extras are now updated in this PR\r\nTesting:\r\nI tested all the recipes by building the changes for rocm-4.3.0 in addition to rocm-4.5.0. \r\nIn addition to that i tested the following for rocblas\r\nspack install -v rocblas@4.5.0 tensile_architecture=gfx906:xnack-,gfx908:xnack-\r\nspack install -v rocblas@4.0.0 => this will build the dependency recipes for rocm-4.0.0\r\nspack install -v rocblas@4.3.1  => this will build the dependency recipes for rocm-4.3.1\r\nspack install -v rocblas@4.5.0\r\ni ran the rocm-bandwidth-test ,rocminfo, rocm-agent-enumerator  etc \r\n**observations -**\r\nfor the rocm-4.5.0 , In the prefix install path for hip, 'hipify-perl', 'hipcc', 'hipconfig', 'hipify-cmakefile', 'hipvars.pm' i see the perl is still /usr/bin/perl and not the perl from the spack installed path.\r\n\r\n",
