    "body": "Installing xz fails due to a certificate issue, which is weird because it's using an `http` URL.\r\n\r\nI'm learning my way around a new system.  It lacks things (no emacs, the horror!) and I'm using Spack to spin them up.\r\n\r\nThe system is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cat /etc/lsb-release\r\nDISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu\r\nDISTRIB_RELEASE=14.04\r\nDISTRIB_CODENAME=trusty\r\nDISTRIB_DESCRIPTION=\"Ubuntu 14.04.1 LTS\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nand I'm using the system compilers and etc...., looks like `v4.8.2`.\r\n\r\nIt's entirely possible that this system has an old set of CA certs or ...  I'll keep digging.\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\nI tried to `spack install git`, which in turn tried to install `xz`.  I expected it to succeed.\r\n\r\n### Actual Result\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Installing xz\r\n==> Fetching http://tukaani.org/xz/xz-5.2.3.tar.bz2\r\n######################################################################## 100.0%\r\ncurl: (60) SSL certificate problem: unable to get local issuer certificate\r\nMore details here: http://curl.haxx.se/docs/sslcerts.html\r\n\r\ncurl performs SSL certificate verification by default, using a \"bundle\"\r\n of Certificate Authority (CA) public keys (CA certs).
