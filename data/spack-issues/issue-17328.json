    "body": "This PR moves:\r\n- [x] `flake8`\r\n- [x] `shell`\r\n- [x]  `documentation`\r\n\r\ntests from Travis to Github Actions. It also changes Python 2.6 unit tests to not compute coverage, since previously we were computing it and consistently failing in the upload phase. As a result Python 2.6 tests now take ~15 mins. to run instead of ~25 mins.",
