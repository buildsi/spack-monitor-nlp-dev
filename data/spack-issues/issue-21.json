    "body": "Lapack has a strange error where the library will be built properly, but the testing phase will fail. I've noticed this on multiple machines (LLNL's Edge and NERSC's Hopper), not just Surface. I've disabled the tests for now, but it shouldn't be too much of an issue for people who just want to install the package.\n",
