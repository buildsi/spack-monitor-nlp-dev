    "body": "### Summary\n\nWe should add an option to `spack url stats` (or maybe `spack url list`) that prints packages that don't use SHA256 yet.\n\n### Rationale\n\n@tgamblin introduced `spack url stats` back in the day when we converted all packages from MD5 to SHA256. At this point, a very small number of packages don't have SHA256 checksums:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack url stats\r\n...\r\n    checksums\r\n        md5                   22     0.1%           0     0.0%\r\n        sha256             17520    86.5%         791    87.6%\r\n        no checksum            7     0.0%           3     0.3%\r\n```\r\nI would like to deprecate the versions that don't have SHA256 (since they likely can no longer be downloaded) but I don't have an easy way to get a list of these packages.\n\n### Description\n\nWe could add an option like `spack url stats --list-md5` or `spack url list --md5` or something like that to display this list.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
