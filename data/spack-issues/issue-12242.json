    "body": "This package produces a single executable, `liggghts`.  I'm not a domain expert in finite particle analysis and the only runtime verification was running `liggghts -help` on that executable.  \r\n\r\nI don't know whether the CI tests all variant combinations.  The `profile` flag has always been disabled.  I've tested combinations of:\r\n\r\n|`mpi` | `debug` | `jpeg` | `gzip`|\r\n|---|---|---|---|\r\n|-|-|-|-|\r\n|+|-|-|-|\r\n|-|+|-|-|\r\n|+|+|-|-|\r\n|+|+|+|+|\r\n|+|-|+|+|\r\n\r\nSome functionality in the `Makefile.user_default` template could not be included because that is part of upstream's premium service.",
