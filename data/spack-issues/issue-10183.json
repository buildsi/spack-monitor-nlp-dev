    "body": "@junghans @tinlun \r\n\r\nI tried installing `flang` in a Docker container based on Ubuntu 16.04. I tried that using both `gcc-7` and `gcc-8`. The `pgmath` dependency fails to build with segfault.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install pgmath # On Ubuntu 16.04\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Building pgmath [CMakePackage]                                                                                                                [1532/30305]\r\n==> Executing phase: 'cmake'\r\n==> Executing phase: 'build'\r\n==> Error: ProcessError: Command exited with status 2:\r\n    'make' '-j32'\r\n\r\n4 errors found in build log:\r\n  >> 357    Segmentation fault (core dumped)\r\n     358    lib/common/CMakeFiles/mth_z2yy.dir/build.make:63: recipe for target 'lib/common/mth_z2yy.c' failed\r\n  >> 359    make[2]: *** [lib/common/mth_z2yy.c] Error 139\r\n     360    make[2]: *** Deleting file 'lib/common/mth_z2yy.c'\r\n     361    make[2]: Leaving directory '/tmp/root/spack-stage/spack-stage-TbIWzt/flang-flang_20180612/spack-build'\r\n     362    CMakeFiles/Makefile2:1044: recipe for target 'lib/common/CMakeFiles/mth_z2yy.dir/all' failed\r\n  >> 363    make[1]: *** [lib/common/CMakeFiles/mth_z2yy.dir/all] Error 2\r\n     364    make[1]: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....\r\n```\r\nthat activate the full debug output. \r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nUbuntu 16.04\r\n\r\n### Reason\r\n\r\nThe default for `awk` in Ubuntu is `mawk`. If I read it right, `pgmath` uses `awk` to generate some of its own source code. `mawk` simply segfaults when running that `awk` command. Using `gawk` to run that awk command seems to be OK.",
