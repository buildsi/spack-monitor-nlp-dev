    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nNothing to reproduce here, but the file `lib/spack/spack/test/spec_yaml.py` could stand to be renamed to something more accurate since spack tries to serialize specs as json now instead of yaml.  One possibility is to rename it to `spec_serialization.py`.\r\n\r\nOriginally suggested by @alalazo in a review [comment](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/28504/files#r814029868) of #28504.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\nNo error message.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nUnrelated to any system.\r\n",
