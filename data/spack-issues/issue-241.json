    "body": "Added GNUPLOT package :\n- [X] support for `readline`, `cairo`, `pango` and other optional libraries\n- [X] variant to activate the wxWidgets terminal\n- [X] patch to fix build of `ncurses` when compiling with `gcc@5.0:` (I think the issue is similar to #149, and that was not solved for me under Ubuntu)\n\nBuild tested manually (with and without `wx`):\n- Ubuntu 14.04\n- RHLE 6\n\nMissing in this PR:\n- variant to support `qt` terminal (it seems I have troubles wit `mesa`, and I guess it could take some time to fix those)\n",
