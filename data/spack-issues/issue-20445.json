    "body": "Hi everyone, first I want to apologize because I am new into ubuntu, so I could be wrong anywhere.\r\n\r\nIn order to install a library, I had to clone spack, and then to install deal.II and vtk. \r\nI followed this code: \r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\n.bashrc file: \"export SPACK_ROOT=/path/to/spack/\r\nexport PATH=${SPACK_ROOT}/bin:${PATH}\"\r\nsudo apt install python git curl make g++ gfortran\r\nmkdir -p ${SPACK_ROOT}\r\ncd ${SPACK_ROOT}\r\ngit clone https://github.com/spack/spack.git .\r\nspack install environment-modules\r\n.bashrc file: \"source $(spack location -i environment-modules)/init/bash\r\nsource ${SPACK_ROOT}/share/spack/setup-env.sh\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nUp to this point, everything seems fine, and I got no errors. \r\nThen I install \r\n\r\n`spack install dealii@9.2.0 ^suite-sparse@5.2.0`\r\n\r\nAnd I get errors as you see in the screen. \r\nDo you have any ideas about what could I do? Thanks everyone! \r\n<img width=\"595\" alt=\"errore dealii\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56541934/102512972-ed8c6e00-408a-11eb-8e5c-aff82b0d2a04.PNG\">\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
