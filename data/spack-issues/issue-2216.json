    "body": "I have a spack tree that I've been working in for a while; I was pleasantly surprised when I noticed that *lmod* modulefiles were being automagically created.\r\n\r\nI cloned a clean tree yesterday to try an end-to-end build of my environment and:\r\n\r\n- `.../share/spack/lmod` is no longer present; and\r\n-  `spack module refresh --help` does not list `lmod` as an available type of module, `spack module refresh` offers to rebuild all my *tcl* modules.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what, if anything, I did go end up with *lmod* modules in my old tree and/or what I've done to loose them in the new tree.\r\n\r\nI read through the [module file support](lib/spack/docs/module_file_support.rst) docs,  but they did not shed any light.\r\n\r\nShould something be happening automagically that isn't, or do I need to configure something, or???",
