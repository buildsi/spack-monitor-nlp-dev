Using this I get all environment as:\n\n```\nspack env mylib@develop bash\n```\n\nand then it works fine. Is above the missing step from the workflow document? \n\nI have another question related to extending `CMakePackage` and  `spconfig.py`:\n\nWhen I started writing packages for CMake based projects, I have extended packages from `Package`. Now when I do `spack setup my_spec` in the source directory of the project, `spconfig.py` is not generated. But I have `install` method defined in the `package.py` with `spack-build` as build directory. So when I invoke`spack setup`, it build and install the package. And then for development purpose I just do:\n\n``` bash\ncd speck-build\nspack env spec_with_spaces - -  bash  \n\n# change code - make - change code .....\n```\n\nwhich works fine! Is there any drawback of this compared to having `spconfig.py`?\n\n@citibeth : any suggestion?\n",
