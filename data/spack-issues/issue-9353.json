    "body": "I am still not clear on how to make spack play nice with existing modules, and need some help.\r\n\r\nSay my environment already have \"cmake/3.9.2\" available as a module compiled with gcc@4.8.5\r\nand I want to install `protobuf` at the latest version. My compiler setting is 6.4.0 by default. The \"concretization\" shows that `protobuf` want to run with `cmake/3.12.2` with `gcc@6.4.0`. \r\n\r\nI want to instruct spack to use existing cmake module by:\r\n```\r\nspack install protobuf%gcc@6.4.0 cmake@3.9.2%gcc@4.8.5\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis doesn't seem work - spack insists on installing a new cmake.  Any help?\r\n\r\n",
