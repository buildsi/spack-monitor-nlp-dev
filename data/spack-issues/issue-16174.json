    "body": "Add missing dependency.\r\n\r\nI believe this also depends on OpenGL?  I could not get `mesa` (OpenGL) building on my macOS Catalina.  I tried using the System built-in OpenGL instead, also to no avail (for other reasons).  Finally I just used the pre-built downloaded Qt distort for macOS and punted on OpenGL / Qt build issues.\r\n\r\nIn any case, I believe `libsecret` does need `pig-config`.",
