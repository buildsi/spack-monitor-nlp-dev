    "body": "The private method `Spec._dup` was missing a line (when setting compiler flags the parent spec was not set to `self`). This resulted in an inconsistent state of the duplicated Spec. This problem has been fixed here. The docstring of `Spec._dup` has been updated.\r\n\r\n~The logic in `Spec.__init__` to assign members to `self` from `spec_list[0]` has been substituted by a call to `Spec._dup`. Even though the latter performs a copy while the former only an assignment, no performance hit has been noticed on an Ubuntu 14.04 platform. Unit tests take from 140 to 150 seconds, and `spack spec trilinos` takes  about 24 seconds, regardless of the change.~",
