Setting `providers: [openmpi]` does nothing.\r\n\r\nNeither `mpt` nor `spectrum-mpi` are in the list of providers in the etc/spack file. Should they be? Should they be deleted? Should they `conflict` with systems that don't support them?\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-970-b700335be7\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-haswell\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
