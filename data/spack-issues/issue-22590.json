    "body": "Packages that depend on the virtual package `rpc` often expect to find `rpc.h` in `$prefix/include/rpc`. But the `libtirpc` package installs the headers one level deeper in `$prefix/include/tirpc/rpc`. An example of a package that breaks is `hdf+external-xdr`.\r\n\r\nTo avoid this, we add `$prefix/include/tirpc` in the search path for dependent packages. This should not break any existing packages, since `$prefix/include` will still be in search path.\r\n\r\nI was debating whether to use CPATH or CFLAGS and decided to use the former. \r\n\r\nThe patch has been tested on CentOS8 with Spack-0.16.1",
