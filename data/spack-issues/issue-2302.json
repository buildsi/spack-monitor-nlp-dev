    "body": "@tgamblin \r\n\r\nSuppose I'm going to build (or have built) a package manually using the `spack setup` stuff.  Typically when I do that, I invent a fake version, I like to use `@local`.  (Unlike `@develop`, Spack does absolutely nothing special with `@local`).  These fake versions are not being picked up from `packages.yaml`.  Witness:\r\n\r\nGood:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec libxml2\r\nlibxml2@2.9.4%gcc@4.9.3~python arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n    ^xz@5.2.2%gcc@4.9.3 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n    ^zlib@1.2.8%gcc@4.9.3 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow I want to setup libxml2 for manually compile... Good:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec libxml2@local\r\nlibxml2@local%gcc@4.9.3~python arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n    ^xz@5.2.2%gcc@4.9.3 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n    ^zlib@1.2.8%gcc@4.9.3 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nSuppose I want to set up libxml2 and xz for manual compile:  Good:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec libxml2@local ^xz@local\r\nlibxml2@local%gcc@4.9.3~python arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n    ^xz@local%gcc@4.9.3 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n    ^zlib@1.2.8%gcc@4.9.3 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut... suppose I put the following in my `packages.yaml`:\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n    xz:\r\n        version: [local]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is not picked up, and I get the same as if it were not there:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec libxml2@local\r\nlibxml2@local%gcc@4.9.3~python arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n    ^xz@5.2.2%gcc@4.9.3 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n    ^zlib@1.2.8%gcc@4.9.3 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
