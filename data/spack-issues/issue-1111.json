    "body": "there are plenty of extension packages one can install for octave by \n\n```\npkg install <archive.xyz.tar>\n```\n\nhowever this is not possible within the current version of Octave in Spack:\n\n```\npkg install specfun-1.1.0.tar.gz\nmkoctfile: stripping disabled on this platform\nmake: *** [ellipj.oct] Error 1\nmkoctfile -s ellipj.cc\nSpack compiler must be run from Spack! Input 'SPACK_PREFIX' is missing.\n\npkg: error running `make' for the specfun package.\n```\n\nI suppose `octave` keeps compilers used during its build for later usage and then fails because Spack's compiler wrappers can't be used outside of spack. Any ideas how to fix it?\n",
