    "body": "Fixes #28417\r\n\r\nThe issue I found is: since 2bd513d6591161d271221bb76bc1420bd3c2b3e3 (spack 0.17), if a config-changing flag is set, then the`spack.config.config` singleton was initialized in `setup_main_options` *before* `spack.config.command_line_scopes` had been set. So the command line scopes were not taken into account during the config initialization.\r\n",
