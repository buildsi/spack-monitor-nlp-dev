    "body": "### Summary\n\nWe should do a better job of documenting how to display a list of all modules loaded by `spack load`. This may require documentation in multiple places, including references in other commands, tutorials, and reference docs. Basically anywhere that we mention that `spack load` exists.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThis is probably the second most common question I see on Slack/GitHub after #22287.\n\n### Description\n\nThe correct command is `spack find --loaded`, but this isn't obvious to a lot of people, myself included.\n\n### Additional information\n\nN/A\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
