    "body": "As a user of Spack I want to be able to use the new set-function / unset-function commands in tcl module files so that I can set or unset shell functions when loading them.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThis is a [new feature](https://modules.readthedocs.io/en/latest/MIGRATING.html#new-modulefile-commands) introduced in v4.2\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis feature requires Modules v4.2. It needs to be checked:\r\n- [ ] How shell functions can be specified in `modules.yaml` \r\n- [ ] If we want the possibility to specify shell functions from `package.py`\r\n\r\nFor the first point we could have a look at [block scalars](https://yaml-multiline.info/) in YAML.",
