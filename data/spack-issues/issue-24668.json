(default is 1, q to abort)  \r\n==> Fetching https://github.com/PyO3/setuptools-rust/archive/refs/tags/v0.12.1.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nWheras if I remove `url=....` from version 0.10.6, version 0.12.1 is correctly fetched from pypi. But this means that 0.10.6 is broken since it does not exist there (and if so the checksum would be wrong).\r\n```\r\n==> How many would you like to checksum?
