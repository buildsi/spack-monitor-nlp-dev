    "body": "This PR allows us to build care and its dependencies with +cuda (targetting nvidia GPUs). \r\n\r\nNOTE: David Beckinsale advises that many \"untested\" architectures are fine to run with cuda, see his branch here: https://github.com/davidbeckingsale/spack/commit/a991a5f3fa98a14857bd1ad8ea3c8ed53ae1b320 . Those changes will remain on David's separate branch and have not been merged in as part of this PR",
