    "body": "This package recently failed with `g++: internal compiler error: Killed (program cc1plus)` on a `c5.2xlarge` (a runner that can get used when we supply the tags: [`spack`, `public`, `large`, `x86_64`]).  This PR causes `kokkos-kernels` to be built on a more capable runner by swapping the `xlarge` tag for the previous `large`.  This will result in getting built on `c5.4xlarge` instead, assuming a cloud runner is used.",
