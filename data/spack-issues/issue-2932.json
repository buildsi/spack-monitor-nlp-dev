    "body": "We're having a problem here I can't diagnose.  The `~/.spack/compilers.yaml` file is set up as follows:\r\n```\r\ncompilers:\r\n- compiler:\r\n    modules: [other/comp/gcc-5.3-sp3,linux-suse_linux11-x86_64/binutils-2.27-gcc-5.3.0-p7ewifc]\r\n    operating_system: suse_linux11\r\n    paths:\r\n      cc: /usr/local/other/SLES11.3/gcc/5.3.0/bin/gcc\r\n      cxx: /usr/local/other/SLES11.3/gcc/5.3.0/bin/g++\r\n      f77: /usr/local/other/SLES11.3/gcc/5.3.0/bin/gfortran\r\n      fc: /usr/local/other/SLES11.3/gcc/5.3.0/bin/gfortran\r\n    spec: gcc@5.3.0\r\n```\r\nWhen we try a Spack command, it doesn't work.  For example:\r\n```\r\n$ spack setup everytrace@develop\r\n==> Error: Multiple compilers satisfy spec gcc@5.3.0\r\n$ spack compilers\r\n==> Available compilers\r\n-- gcc ----------------------------------------------------------\r\ngcc@5.3.0  gcc@5.3.0  gcc@4.9.1  gcc@4.3.4  gcc@4.3\r\n```\r\nWhy is `gcc@5.3.0` there twice?  `which gcc` yields:\r\n```\r\n/usr/local/other/SLES11.3/gcc/5.3.0/bin/gcc\r\n```\r\nNow if we get rid of `compilers.yaml`, everything works fine.  And Spack does not create a new `compilers.yaml` file.\r\n\r\nAny idea what is going wrong?  This stuff worked for 10 other students running on the same supercomputer.  We did `module purge` and are running with `bash`.\r\n\r\n",
