    "body": "There was a bug in 2.36.* of missing Makefile dependencies.  The\r\nprevious workaround was to require 2.36 to be built serially.  This is\r\nnow fixed upstream in 2.37 and this PR adds the patch to restore\r\nparallel make to 2.36.\r\n\r\nping @alalazo as maintainer\r\n\r\n@michaelkuhn I didn't mean to step on your other PR #26521.  I noticed\r\nthis problem while looking at your PR.  But they're separate enough\r\nthat rebasing one should be straightforward.\r\n\r\n(One of those things that either I have to do it now while I remember,\r\nor else put it aside and I won't get back to it for 3 months. :-( \r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI tried to write a URL spec for the patch, but there are two problems\r\nwith that.\r\n\r\n1. The binutils/gdb home repo is on sourceforge.  I clicked around\r\ntheir website for a URL that would give me the raw patch (without\r\nHTML), but I couldn't find anything.  You may notice, there aren't any\r\nother URL patches for sourceforge in the spack packages.\r\n\r\n2. The upstream patch that fixes this modifies three files: two\r\nMakefiles plus ChangeLog.  ChangeLog is a prepend-only file and thus\r\nany patch to it will only ever apply cleanly to its git parent, not\r\nthe 2.36.1 tarfile.  Blech.\r\n",
