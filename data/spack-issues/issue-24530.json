    "body": "As a supplement to https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/24529, it would be really useful to have a clearly defined \"Use Cases\" sections in the documentation. E.g., speaking to the use cases in the format\r\n\r\n - Who am I\r\n - What problem am I trying to solve\r\n - How do I use spack to do it\r\n\r\nYou can imagine it's different for groups maintaining software for users, vs. a single user, vs. wanting containers or environments. I think these should be described very clearly for a new user that is trying to understand how spack could be useful to him or her.",
