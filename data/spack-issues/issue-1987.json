    "body": "- This change fixes a problem that manifests when trilinos is built against a MKL installation defined as an external package. In this scenario, the MKL libraries are found one directory deeper than for the case where spack provides MKL. The extra directory is a platform name like 'intel64'.\n- The changes in this PR were recommended by contributor @davydden. I implemented and tested with intel@16.0.3. These changes fix the issue I reported. I did not attempt building trilinos against other BLAS implementations.\n- fixes #1923\n",
