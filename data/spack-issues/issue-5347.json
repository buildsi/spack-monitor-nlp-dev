We've been playing keep-up with them, but I'm proposing it's not worth it.\r\n\r\nI seem to end up installing it '--no-checksum' anyway.\r\n\r\nThis commit updates the package to make that approach official, removing the checksum, adding a note to the description and a bigger note/comment inthe package body.",
