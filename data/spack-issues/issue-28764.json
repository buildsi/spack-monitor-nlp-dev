    "body": "When a prefix of a dep is removed, and the db is reindexed, it is added\r\nthrough the dependent, but until now it incorrectly listed the spec as\r\n'installed'.\r\n\r\nIt also fixes an issue when the same spec was added multiple times, it would\r\nalways be marked installed, even though it was not.\r\n\r\nLastly it fixes some edge cases where removing an uninstalled, non-external\r\nspec errored if it had never been installed in the database in the first place\r\n(e.g. prefix of some root spec is gone, it's added back on spack reindex\r\nthrough the old index.json -- but due to a bug you would not be able to\r\nremove this missing entry from the database.)",
