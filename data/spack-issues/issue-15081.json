    "body": "Depends: #15058\r\n\r\nlibfabric used to install fabtests only when installed using --test. fabtests has tools that are useful on a running system, so they should be installed always.\r\n\r\n* Rewrote the build/install part to always install fabtests alongside libfabric.\r\n* Updated a few fabtests resources.\r\n* Updated the test related stuff. Works for most versions now.\r\n* Include tcp and udp fabrics so that the test suite works.",
