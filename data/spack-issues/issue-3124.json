    "body": "What would others think if we (optionally) add the `-g` compiler flag in Spack wrappers?  This would ensure that debugging symbols are present in all Spack binaries.  Other than saving a little bit of HDD space (cheap these days), there is very little to be gained by NOT using `-g`.  And in modern compilers, it even gives useful information with higher `-O` levels.\r\n\r\nHow would such an option be implemented?",
