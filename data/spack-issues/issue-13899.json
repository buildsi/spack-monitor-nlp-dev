    "body": "Hi There,\r\nThe current cuda package.py is written only for x86_64 architecture. I would like to add ppc64le, however, there is currently no switch based on the architecture.\r\nWhat is the best way to differentiate \"version\" based on the architecture ?\r\n```\r\n    version('10.2.89',\r\n            '3d816c583759efa8567a92c1a2af90db',\r\n            expand=False,\r\n            url=\"http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.2/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux.run\")\r\n    version('10.2.89',\r\n            'ecb6af432e64bc10e7a18cd6bd4be62f',\r\n            expand=False,\r\n            url=\"http://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.2/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.2.89_440.33.01_linux_ppc64le.run\")\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn addition, the checksum used is sha256sum in the existing file, while the list provided by nvidia is md5sum. With md5sum, people could just check the content of package.py vs what is provided on nvidia website, that would add a security check.\r\n\r\nLudo",
