    "body": "Add test functionality to pybind11.\r\nWithout tests, this will skip the build and dependencies of the tests.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a check in CMake for targets `check` in `make/ninja check` for tests. This is now the same as in the build systems `Makefile` and `Autotools` and can be useful for manually added CMake targets for projects that do not (yet) use `CTest`.",
