    "body": "This PR builds on the detection mechanism introduced in #15158 and refined in #16526 and moves all the compiler detection logic to packages. This includes finding compilers on Cray by inspection of the environment modules. To this end the `spack external find` command has been extended with a new option `--craype` and new logic to inspect Cray Programming Environments has been added.\r\n\r\nThe `spack compiler find` command has been modified to rely on `spack external find` for compiler detection  \r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n- [x] Compiler detection logic is moved from `spack.compilers` to builtin packages\r\n- [x] Added a mechanism to search for external packages on Cray\r\n- [x] Added packages for each compiler supported by Spack\r\n- [x] XL compilers have been split into `xlc` and `xlf`\r\n- [x] CCE compilers have been split into `cce-classic` (Cray frontend) and `cce` (LLVM frontend)\r\n- [x] Added a way to bundle detection tests with packages by a `detection_test.yaml` file living alongside `package.py`\r\n- [ ] Document how to make a package detectable on Cray",
