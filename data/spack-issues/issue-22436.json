In my case `len(lines) == 41` and `len(_annotations) == 38`, which means that the last 3 config entries are not printed:\r\n\r\n```allow_sgid: True', '  debug: False', '  build_jobs: 2'```\r\n\r\nare nowhere to be seen in the output.\r\n\r\nMaybe related: the \"package_lock_timeout: null\" option is printed in a weird way:\r\n\r\n```package_lock_timeout: !!null 'None'```",
