    "body": "I'd like ability to see external packages in the concretized output so its easy to know what packages are external and which are not\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThis is used to identify package preference and help pinpoint before doing `spack install` what are the issues.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn this concretized output, I have specified `m4` as an external. The symbol on left `-` is not clear if its an external or installed from source. The `[+]` is clear that package is installed.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[+]  yxi7z3o                  ^libtool@2.4.6%gcc@10.2.0 arch=cray-sles15-zen2\r\n -   wlj6ezo                      ^m4@1.4.18%gcc@10.2.0+sigsegv patches=3877ab548f88597ab2327a2230ee048d2d07ace1062efe81fc92e91b7f39cd00,fc9b61654a3ba1a8d6cd78ce087e7c96366c290bc8d2c299f09828d793b853c8 arch=cray-sles15-zen2\r\n```\r\nI would propose we have a `[E]` for external package. We can potentially extend this to other names during concretizer for labels to help see concretized output\r\n\r\nThis also relates to https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/18588 when trying to analyze output of `spack concretize` to make it easy to digest the information considering when we concretize a huge software stack. These changes to concretized output will be appreciated.\r\n\r\nThis was discussed in https://spackpm.slack.com/archives/C5W7NKZJT/p1625194987305100",
