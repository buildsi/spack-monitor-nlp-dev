    "body": "I see this was added 2 days ago, it should probably not be the preferred version.  Or at the very least, give a warning if `+mpi+python` detected?\r\n\r\nThere's something weird going on with `mpi` and `python` asked for at the same time.  If I ask for both, neither py2 or py3 can build.  `~mpi+python` builds _for both_, though.\r\n\r\n```\r\n/tmp/sven/spack-stage/spack-stage-eUP7Zi/boost_1_64_0/spack-build.out:194:./boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:23: fatal error: pyconfig.h: No such file or directory\r\n/tmp/sven/spack-stage/spack-stage-eUP7Zi/boost_1_64_0/spack-build.out:210:./boost/mpi/python/serialize.hpp:404:16: error: 'make_array' is not a member of 'boost::serialization'\r\n/tmp/sven/spack-stage/spack-stage-eUP7Zi/boost_1_64_0/spack-build.out:214:./boost/mpi/python/serialize.hpp:445:9: error: 'make_array' is not a member of 'boost::serialization'\r\n/tmp/sven/spack-stage/spack-stage-eUP7Zi/boost_1_64_0/spack-build.out:14210:./boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:23: fatal error: pyconfig.h: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt seems this [is a known issue](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12516), noting from the last comment that `boost@1.63.0` works fine.  I have verified this, the `boost@1.63.0+python+mpi` works for both python2 and 3.\r\n\r\n",
