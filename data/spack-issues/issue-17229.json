    "body": "Aliases can be used to define new commands. For instance, `sp: spec -I` will define a new command `sp` that will execute `spec` with the `-I` argument. Aliases cannot override existing commands.\r\n\r\nThis is still WIP and is missing some things, including schema adaptions and porting the old aliases to the new system. It already works in general. For convenience, there is an example alias `sp` (which I will remove for the final version). I would just like to get some feedback on whether this is something of interest.\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart @tgamblin @alalazo\r\n\r\nCloses #2705",
