I found packaging of Expat 2.2.0 to 2.3.0 in Spack: https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/c8868f1922c91fb7d8635ed88a06159857a7cae6/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/expat/package.py#L16-L22\r\n\r\nAll releases of Expat <2.4.0 are [known vulnerable](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/master/expat/Changes), the latest release upstream is 2.4.1. It would be great to get the Spack user base on safe ground. Thank you! :pray: \r\n\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nn/a\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [ ] ~I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform~\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] ~I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output~\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
