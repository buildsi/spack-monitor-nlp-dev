    "body": "This PR adds `py-tensorboard` version 2.5.0. I've run into 2 issues so far:\r\n\r\n1. tensorboard 2.5.0 requires bazel 3.7+, but tensorboard-plugin-wit can't be built with bazel 3.7+: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/issues/5152\r\n2. tensorboard 2.5.0 adds a new dependency on tensorboard-data-server. Source code can be found at https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorboard/tree/master/tensorboard/data/server. I tried porting the py-tensorboard package build commands to this package, but they aren't working. I'm starting to think that this is a private, internal package that might be built automatically when building tensorboard, so maybe we don't need a separate package for it?\r\n\r\nI'm hoping @aweits can take over the rest for me, feel free to push to this branch.",
