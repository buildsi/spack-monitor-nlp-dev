    "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\n1. It has variants `cluster`, `shared`, `ilp64` which do not influence the contents of the installation, this can lead to many redundant copies of a 6GB+ installation :(.\r\n  \r\n   These variants should be removed, and replaced with query parameters (https://spack-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/sc20/tutorial_advanced_packaging.html#extra-query-parameters) I can't find the actual docs for this feature.\r\n\r\n2. Currently .libs returns system libraries, even when +shared. This should never happen.\r\n\r\nGenerally I think Spack is too high level to support static linking, cause it doesn't know dependencies. Why not use pkgconfig file or whatever you have. They know the actual linker flags.\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
