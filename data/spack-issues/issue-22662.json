    "body": "Currently, if a concrete spec is passed to `spack.database.Database._query()` only the `hashes` filter is applied. This PR applies the same logic to concrete and abstract specs and adds tests for all `_query()` parameters.\r\n\r\nExample use case where false positives are returned:\r\n```python\r\nconcrete_spec = ...  # a concrete spec based on result of 'spack find -X'\r\nspack.store.db.query(query_spec=concrete_spec, explicit=True)  # returns implicit and explicit specs with same hash as concrete_spec\r\n```\r\n",
