    "body": "When running `spack gpg` it's unclear what gpg is being used. Spack will try `gpg2` in the path if available and otherwise `gpg`. On systems with both gnupg1 and gnupg2 it will always use gnupg2, but I'd like it to use gnupg1; or maybe some gpg that I've built with spack not in the PATH. Can we have a SPACK_GPG variable to override the educated guess from spack?\r\n\r\n",
