This worked on our RHEL7 systems,\r\nbut on the RHEL8 system I tried there is no 'python' in my path (only 'python2' or 'python3'), so it aborts.  \r\n\r\nAlthough python is a fairly basic utility on Linux systems, and as far as I can see is only being used as build dependency, I suggest adding a python build dependency to bml.\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nspack  install bml @1.3.1%gcc@8.4.0 +mpi+shared build_type=Release\r\n...\r\n  >> 289    /usr/bin/env: 'python': No such file or directory\r\n  >> 290    make[2]: *** [src/Fortran-interface/CMakeFiles/bml-fortran.dir/buil\r\n            d.make:77: src/Fortran-interface/bml_utilities_double_complex_m.F90\r\n            ] Error 127\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\nspack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-ivybridge\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n[spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5170859/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n[spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5170861/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\nNo maintainers found\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x ] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [ x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
