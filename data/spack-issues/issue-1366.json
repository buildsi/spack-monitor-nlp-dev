For now just trust that there's one available, perhaps\nsomeday we can/should uncomment the depends_on('perl').\n\nFollows the methodolgy I used in nextflow.  Has the same\nuninstall/install problem that nextflow has, there is an issue in\nprogress for that: https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/1308.\n\nTested on CentOS7.\n",
