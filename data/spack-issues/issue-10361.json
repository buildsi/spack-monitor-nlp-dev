    "body": "I am trying to learn \"Module Files\" in the tutorial Spack 101, where it is suggested to install the package  `scipy` with the command:\r\n\r\n`spack load gcc@7.2.0`\r\n`spack install py-scipy ^openblas`\r\n\r\nI simply started everything from the default, exactly following the steps in the [page](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_modules.html#setup-for-the-tutorial). However I got the following error:\r\n\r\n`Original error was: libmkl_rt.so: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory`\r\n\r\nI uninstalled `py-numpy` and re-ran the installation again. The error persists. Any advice?\r\n",
