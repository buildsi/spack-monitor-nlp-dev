    "body": "This transitions the WarpX package to use its new CMake build logic.\r\n\r\nIntroduces packages:\r\n- `py-picmistandard`: https://github.com/picmi-standard/picmi\r\n- `py-warpx` for the PICMI python bindings of WarpX\r\n\r\nAccording to my tests, this should also fix the installation errors that we currently observe in nightly setup tests: https://dev.azure.com/ECP-WarpX/WarpX/_build/results?buildId=1529&view=results\r\n\r\nRequires #21770 to build by workaround-free with RZ geometry.\r\n\r\nI'll start introducing fixed versions after the next major release, so long we build from `development`.\r\n\r\ncc @dpgrote @remilehe",
