    "body": "i don't know what is the plan, but i think it would be good to freeze adding any extra features after `0.10` \"project\" is fulfilled and let everyone try building their favourite packages on their favourite OS+compiler combos. During this time only bug-fix PRs should be accepted. \n\nAlternatively there could be a seprate `0.10` branch to test. Bugfix PRs could be submitted to this branch and the whole branch can be merged to `develop`. \n",
