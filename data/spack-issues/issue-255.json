    "body": "@kiwifb: How does this look?  I was able to build XL, gcc, and Intel versions of mpich with it.\n\n@lee218llnl: can you test this with some of the problematic `distutils` builds?  I think this should fix the issues you were seeing before because compilers will now have detectable names.  You can probably remove your prior patch.\n\nSee #254 and [this thread](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spack/spygC81rbc8) for details.\n\nThis changes the compiler wrappers so that they are called by the same\nname as the wrapped compiler.  Many builds make assumptions about\ncompiler names, and we need the spack compilers to be recognizable so\nthat build systems will get their flags right.\n\nThis adds per-compiler subdirectories to lib/spack/spack/env directory\nthat contain symlinks to cc for the C, C++, F77, and F90\ncompilers. The build now sets CC, CXX, F77, and F90 to point to these\nlinks instead of to the generically named cc, c++, f77, and f90\nwrappers.\n",
