The heuristic is:\r\n\r\n\r\n* if an archive url exists, prefer it and take its version\r\n  * if a reference package is available\r\n    * generate a url from the package with pkg.url_from_version\r\n    * if they match\r\n      * stop considering other URLs for this version\r\n      * otherwise, continue replacing the url for the version\r\n  * otherwise use specified archive url list to generate a list of urls with\r\n    substitute_version\r\n    * if url matches one in the list, use it and don't re-assign it\r\n* if all else fails, just keep assigning over the url repeatedly like it used to\r\n\r\nI doubt this will always work, but it should address a variety of\r\nversions of this bug.  A good test right now is `spack checksum gh`,\r\nwhich checksums macos binaries without this, and the correct source\r\npackages with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nfixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/15985\r\nfixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/14129\r\nfixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/13940\r\n",
