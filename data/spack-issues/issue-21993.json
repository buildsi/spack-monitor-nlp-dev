    "body": "Follow-up to #21932 and #21875.\r\n\r\n`elfutils` cannot be built on macOS. I'm unable to build it with either Apple Clang or GCC. `kcov` builds just fine for me without this dependency. If you look at https://github.com/SimonKagstrom/kcov/blob/master/INSTALL.md, `elfutils` and `libiberty` are only recommended on Linux, not on macOS. I don't know CMake well enough to figure out how this works, but the build doesn't seem to link to these things on macOS.",
