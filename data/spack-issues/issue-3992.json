    "body": "The blast+ configure script supports building\r\n--with-{python,perl}=path and --without-{python,perl}.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes the use of those two languages configurable via\r\nvariants and adds dependencies and explicit --with-... or\r\n--without-... flags to configure.\r\n\r\nPython was a non-optional dependency, now it is a variant that\r\ndefaults to `True`.\r\n\r\nPerl was not previously an explicit dependency but the configure\r\nscript was likely to discover one on your system (`/usr/bin/perl`).\r\nIt is now a variant that defaults to `True`.\r\n\r\nI am unable to accurately determine what these flags to the configure\r\nscript enable.  My users are frustrated by the dependency on Python in\r\nparticular because it constrains the other modules that they can have\r\nloaded for new discernible benefit.",
