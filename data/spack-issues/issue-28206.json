    "body": "### Summary\n\nI propose to add a `--reuse-external` configuration option as a weaker but more deterministic alternative to the new `--reuse` interface coming to Spack.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe idea is to avoid reinstalling available system packages, but don't try to actively reuse previously Spack-installed packages. I believe this would retain a majority of the predictability that we currently have, while avoiding the overhead of reinstalling system packages. This may even be a less drastic candidate for the new default than `--reuse`. I understand the new `--reuse` interface is currently experimental and an interface based on config files is in the works. A possible interface would be an option like this in an environment's `spack.yaml` file:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nconcretization: together\r\n# ...\r\nreuse: external  # or: none, all\r\n```\n\n### Description\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
