This is due to \"historical\" reasons, since Github allows to \"require\" tests by name and any change in required names means that PRs have to re-run CI .\r\n\r\nThis PR tries to rename jobs running unit tests to something more sensible, and can be merged as soon as another PR that would require to re-run CI on all of the PRs is merged.",
