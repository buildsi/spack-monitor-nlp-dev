    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\n\nSo far I've only seen this in job batch scripts and not in interactive terminals, but I don't know what the difference is yet.\r\n\r\nThese scripts have a line that looks something like `. /ccs/home/carns/working/src/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh`, with the path varying depending on where spack is located.\r\n\r\nThis command reports a failure, though spack appears to work correctly afterwards if you script is not too picky about checking return codes.\r\n\n\n### Error message\n\n```\r\n/ccs/home/carns/working/src/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh: line 143: unalias: despacktivate: not found\r\n```\n\n### Information on your system\n\n```\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-915-c11ce3bd1f\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-power9le\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n```\r\nThis is from the Summit system at the OLCF, but we have seen the same error on at least two entirely different systems at ANL.\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
