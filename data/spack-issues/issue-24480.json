    "body": "<!--*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*-->\r\nLike configuration, mirrors and repositories Spack should support to store environment definitions in a scoped fashion. This would allow users to separate their own environments from the official Spack git tree.\r\n\r\n### Rationale / Description\r\n\r\nWhen creating a new environment using `spack env create NEW_ENV` the required file system structure is created under `$SPACK/var/spack/environments/$NEW_ENV` according to [the documentation](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html).\r\n\r\nWhile there may exist various levels of configuration files and within those, various paths for repositories and mirrors, there currently is no way for a user or site to define environments independent of the path where the Spack installation resides.\r\n\r\nIn the end this means that a user needs write access to the Spack installation path in order to create and manage environments although this might not be possible if the Spack installation is provided by the organization running the compute system.\r\n\r\nOne might suggest to just clone another Spack installation but with that the user might loose the benefits from the centrally managed Spack instance.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n```\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-3213-7b6ca59\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-broadwell\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
