    "body": "The [autodiff](https://github.com/autodiff/autodiff) and [vecmem](https://github.com/acts-project/vecmem) packages are standalone packages that are [bundled](https://github.com/acts-project/acts/tree/main/thirdparty/autodiff) [with](https://github.com/acts-project/acts/tree/main/thirdparty/vecmem) acts. This turns them into independent packages and includes them as dependencies of acts.\r\n\r\n@HadrienG2 Since these are primary dependencies of acts, I have taken the liberty of adding you to the maintainer list as well.\r\n\r\nComments:\r\n- I have no GPU infrastructure to test vecmem on.\r\n- While autodiff is fairly mature and an explicit version dependence has always been present in acts, for vecmem that is a bit murkier.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n- [x] Remove some of the initial versions so only the last point releases for autodiff 0.5 and 0.6 are present.\r\n- [ ] Determine which versions of vecmem are actually needed for which acts version",
