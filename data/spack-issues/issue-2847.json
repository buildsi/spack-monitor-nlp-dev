    "body": "If your run `spack help` on any particular command, you'll notice that some options start with a lowercase letter and end with a period, while others start with a capital letter and don't end with a period. This was really messing with my OCD, so I fixed it.\r\n\r\nI decided to standardize on starting with a lowercase letter and not ending with a period. Why? Because argparse automatically adds the `-h / --help` option to every command, and that's what it uses. Yes, we could hack this if we really want to, but I don't see any reason to.",
