    "body": "<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2. Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nBuild package `llvm`. The resulting `clang` executable does not work.\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install llvm\r\n$ /Users/eschnett/src/CarpetX/spack/opt/spack/darwin-bigsur-skylake/apple-clang-12.0.0/llvm-12.0.0-xgtbps6hvrnen4poxqk543se2tzf4wtw/bin/clang -o hello hello.c\r\nhello.c:1:10: fatal error: 'stdio.h' file not found\r\n#include <stdio.h>\r\n         ^~~~~~~~~\r\n1 error generated.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI updated the Spack description of the Apple Clang system compiler as described in https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/23036 to make the build succeed. That is, I point to a gfortran executable that presumably remains unused.\r\n\r\nThe same thing happens with the earlier version `llvm @11.1.0`.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n```\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2302-448ac2c68d\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-bigsur-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt]()\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt]()\r\n\r\nThe build completes successfully; I do not have these files.\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n@naromero77\r\n@trws\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
