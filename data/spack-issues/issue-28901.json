    "body": "CC/CXX/FC/F77 will be set in the run environment and the module file. This makes the behavior consistent with other spack packages that include compilers: intel-parallel-studio, dpcpp, nvhpc, pgi.\r\n\r\nThe package contains multiple compilers, and you can control the choice with a variant. Defaults to icx (CC=icx). You can do CC=icc or CC=dpcpp if you want the other compilers.\r\n\r\nAddresses issue from #28768 \r\n\r\nI tested with:\r\n```\r\nsource share/spack/setup-env.sh && printenv > before.txt && spack load intel-oneapi-compilers CC=dpcpp && printenv > after.txt && diff before.txt after.txt\r\n```",
