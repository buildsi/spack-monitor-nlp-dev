    "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nWe have run into a unique situation where we want to migrate our application stack built on Centos8 over to Rocky8. \r\n\r\nAll the binaries work fine, but from Spack's point of view these two are different targets: `linux-centos8-zen3` and `linux-rocky8-zen3`. As a result, Spack does not recognize the compilers. I can manually edit the `compilers.yaml` to change OS to rocky8, but I am guessing all the package hashes will also change and spack will want to reinstall everything it already installed for centos8.\r\n\r\nIs there an easy way to avoid rebuilding my entire application stack? Can I edit Spack to believe rocky8 is same as centos8?\r\n\r\nAt this point the best I can think of is to explicitly specify `arch=linux-centos8-zen3` for every single application. Can this be specified in `packages.yaml`?\r\n\r\nWould appreciate any suggestions to navigate this.  @tgamblin @alalazo @adamjstewart \r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.16.2-3941-79c2d55830\r\n```\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
