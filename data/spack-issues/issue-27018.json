    "body": "6.1.0 changes compared to 6.0.0:\r\n-  Change default BLR blocksize, and in the BLR preconditioner use right-looking algorithm as the default. This has higher peak memory usage, but is much faster and more robust.\r\n- Fixes in printing of compression statistics.\r\n- Always build the test when doing 'make', you no longer have to run 'make tests'.\r\n- Setup CI at github and gitlab, remove Travis testing.\r\n",
