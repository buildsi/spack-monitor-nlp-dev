    "body": "When `sbang` is installed to the install directory, its permissions are hardcoded to 0o755. This change uses the permissions defined in `packages.yaml:packages:permissions:all` instead. This should allow multiple users to install packages with different versions of Spack to the same install directory cleanly if they are members of the same group and that group is specified in `packages:all:permissions:write`",
