I have also reproduced this problem on a similar Power9 Linux + IBM XL platform here at LANL (i.e., Darwin).\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n[spack-command-debug-output.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6887731/spack-command-debug-output.txt)\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
