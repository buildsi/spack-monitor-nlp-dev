    "body": "Python 3.10 has reached the release candidate phase. Notable changes to the build system are: https://docs.python.org/3.10/whatsnew/3.10.html#build-changes\r\n\r\nThe only other major change to note is that the `distutils` module will be deprecated in Python 3.10 and removed in 3.12. Since Spack builds everything from source, we're likely to get hit by this for all packages that haven't yet moved to setuptools. We use distutils in a few places during installation of Python packages, so we'll need to remove this or add a dependency on setuptools. See https://docs.python.org/3.10/whatsnew/3.10.html#distutils.",
