    "body": "Hey everyone,\r\n\r\nI just posted this to our [Google Group](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spack/o_VJvGFGUFs), but I'm going to be hosting a Spack Tutorial next week here at ANL. If you're in the Chicago area and would like to attend, let me know.\r\n\r\nMore importantly, I need a list of packages that I can install during the packaging demonstration. Does anyone have any requests for software they would like to see in Spack? Ideally, it would be fairly simple to package and wouldn't have too many dependencies. I would also like at least one package from each of the following build systems:\r\n\r\n* `MakefilePackage`\r\n* `AutotoolsPackage`\r\n* `CMakePackage`\r\n* `PythonPackage`\r\n* `RPackage`\r\n\r\nI'll mark this post as `up-for-grabs` so that new users can find a list of software to attempt to package.",
