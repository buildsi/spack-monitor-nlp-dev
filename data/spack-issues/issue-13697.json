    "body": "- awk is a build depdency for this package\r\n\r\nThere is an [issue](https://dev.gnupg.org/rE7865041c77f4f7005282f10f9b6666b19072fbdf) with libgpg-error and gawk >= 5.0 which will be fixed in any release version of libgpg-error (it's the third commit on their master branch after the release tag 1.36). Therefore there should be a requirement in the sense of \r\n\r\n    depends_on('awk@:4, when='@:1.36', type='build')\r\n    depends_on('awk@4:, when='@1.37:', type='build')\r\n\r\nBut since awk is a virtual dependency this would not work I assume? Shall I leave it as it is or specify this version constraint for each awk provider?",
