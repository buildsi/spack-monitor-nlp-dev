    "body": "### Summary\n\nUse `install_name_tool -id '@rpath/${filename}' ${prefix}/${filename}` to fix up macOS libraries installed by autotools that have `LC_ID_DYLIB` hard-coded by `libtool`. This would make autotools-installed libraries consistent with CMake-installed libraries in that they use RPATH for propagating link information rather than hard-coding it.\n\n### Rationale\n\nWhereas most spack-CMake-installed packages install libraries with an `install_name` as `@rpath/libname.dylib` (which shows up in `LC_ID_DYLIB` in `otool -l ${path} | grep -A3 LC_ID_DYLIB`), most autotools (libtool) packages hard-code the install prefix using `-install_name ${PREFIX}/lib/${LIBNAME}`. This propagates the hardcoded library path into downstream libraries, making them more difficult to relocate (changing rpaths is insufficient, you have to know the dependent paths and use `-change`).\r\n\r\nPatching the installed libraries vastly simplifies the relocation of *any* downstream library, installed by spack or not, because only the `rpath` needs to change.\n\n### Description\n\nI would either add a configuration option or a `@after('install')` hook to the Autotools package, and adjust any non-autotools packages (such as `zstd`) to perform the fixup as needed.\n\n### Additional information\n\nIt looks like @gartung is credited with making macOS files relocatable (`spack.relocate`) so perhaps he has some opinions and a better idea of potential pitfalls?\r\n\r\nSpack version 0.16.3-4706-3157a97743\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
