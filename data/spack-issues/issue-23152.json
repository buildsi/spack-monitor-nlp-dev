    "body": "This isn't a significant issue, but I noticed that the docstring incorrectly references \"tty.fail\" and I wanted to quickly fix it to reflect the correct command, tty.die. I also wanted to fix the docstrings to not be large clumps, to what @tgamblin suggested after I wrote this - having one line at the top that is a quick summary, and more verbose after that. This should change absolutely nothing other than the docstrings. One tiny step to making them better!",
