    "body": "Post https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/16043, the install for `petsc+complex` fails after successful concretization (since `petsc+complex` does not depend on `hypre` but the `hypre` variant is turned on by default) with spack complaining that it is dealing with an invalid DAG. \r\n\r\nThis PR adds a conflict to prevent the above situation and simplifies the dependency logic (and also updates PETSc's internal hypre configure reference to the current one).\r\n\r\n@balay ",
