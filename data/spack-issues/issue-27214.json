    "body": "When an upstream uses `~` in its `install_tree`, e.g. like so:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  1 upstreams:\r\n  2   spack-instance-one:\r\n  3     install_tree: ~/.spack/opt/spack-one\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpack fails to find the files it needs, `index.json` being one of those files. As a result, (most) Spack commands fail with:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Error: No database index file is present, and upstream databases cannot generate an index file\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis behavior is due to `os.path.isfile` and `open()` not being able to correctly interpret the `~`.\r\nHere, I apply `os.path.expanduser` to `_db_dir`, so that `_db_dir` refers to the absolute path of the `install_tree`.\r\n\r\n**Update:** I now apply `os.path.expanduser` to `root`.",
