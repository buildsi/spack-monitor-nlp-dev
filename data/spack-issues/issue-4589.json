    "body": "This fixes a run-time failure for certain types of calculations using `libint`. According to [this](https://github.com/misteliy/cp2k/blob/master/tools/hfx_tools/libint_tools/README_LIBINT) page:\r\n\r\n- If you want to use basis functions with higher angular momenta, you have to provide this information to the configure script of `libint`. We pass `--with-libint-max-am=5 --with-libderiv-max-am1=4`.\r\n\r\n- This information is encoded in a macro defined in two headers within `libint`\r\n\r\n- You have to specify again the same info in cp2k, but the two numbers must be incremented by 1 for whatever reason. If you fail doing that everything will compile and link. Failure is at run-time...\r\n\r\nSide rant: technically, using macros that start with a double underscore puts the application in the UB realm. See [latest draft of C99 standard](http://www.open-std.org/jtc1/sc22/wg14/www/docs/n1256.pdf) section 7.1.3.",
