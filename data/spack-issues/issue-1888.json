    "body": "From @tgamblin \n\n@goxberry: I'm hoping to get specs documented eventually. They're currently kind of extensible, although I'd really like to get the constraint login in there to make it so the concretization code is essentially declarative. Allowing plugins or something for different fields on Specs would be a start to that but I think the more important thing at the moment is making the concretization better... it basically needs a better solver. Thanks for the contributions and sorry this took a while to merge!\n",
