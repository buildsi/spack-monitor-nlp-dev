    "body": "This PR fixes two issues which I discovered in the bohrium package related to the recently added opencv variant.\r\n\r\nThis issues were found while developing the small test examples, the second commit adds on top. Especially for this second commit, I am a bit surprised by the amount of messing with the environment I had to do in order to get the PYTHONPATH set up. Maybe there is a simpler way to do this, that I am unaware.\r\n\r\nSimilarly for the modification of the PATH: This is needed, since bohrium internally invokes `cc` and `ld` as it just-in-time compiles code. If the spack-specific overrides for these commands are not removed, the tests do not work.\r\n\r\nNote: This PR relies on the changes of #6457.",
