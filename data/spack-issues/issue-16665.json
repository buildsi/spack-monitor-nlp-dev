    "body": "Compilers specified in `packages.yaml` should be used for dependencies even if the dependent package is being built with a different compiler.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nIn a spack environment I use a combination of specs in `spack.yaml` and configuration in a `packages.yaml` to control what will be installed. Sometimes we try to install a package with a compiler, but one of its dependencies can't be built successfully with that compiler.\r\n\r\nThe selection of the compiler during concretization is a preference issue. Since we have indicated a preference in `packages.yaml`, that compiler should be preferred unless an explicit conflict for the specific package exists in the spec.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI want to be able to just specify the preferred compiler in `packages.yaml` and have that compiler be used for concretization unless I explicitly specify otherwise in the spec.\r\n\r\nWe can add `^dependency%other-compiler@version` to the spec in `spack.yaml`, but that gets verbose quickly.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.14.2-1129-955a3db\r\n```",
