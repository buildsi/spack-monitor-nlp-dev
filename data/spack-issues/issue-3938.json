    "body": "@svenevs Can you see if this fixes the bug you uncovered in https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/2548#issuecomment-296227466?\r\n\r\n@tgamblin I know I've seen this bug before but I haven't quite put my finger on it yet. It seems like if one package says:\r\n```python\r\ndepends_on('python@:2.7.999')\r\n```\r\nand another says:\r\n```python\r\ndepends_on('python@2.7:')\r\n```\r\nfor some reason, concretization dies. Hopefully this will be fixed in the new concretizer.",
