    "body": "I have a problem with `view` in envrionments. I was adding a new package and activating/de-activating my environment. I ended up NOT needing the new package. \r\nBut somewhere environment \"remembers\" that this package exists, so if I switch branches I try to use the environment without the package being available as a part of Spack I get an error\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Error: Package 'foo' not found\r\n```\r\n\r\n`spack reindex` does not help, I tried to remove the corresponding folder from `.spack-env` inside `spack/var/spack/environments/<bar>/` but this does not solve the issue either.\r\n\r\nRight now I can only work with my environment if I disable view: `view: false`.
