    "body": "The `spack config add` command works to infer the type of a config entry from the existing value or the validation error raised when adding `None`.\r\n\r\nThere was a bug reported by @rhd on Spack slack that the following shell code raised an error\r\n```\r\nspack config add packages:all:target:[x86_64]\r\nspack config add packages:all:variants:~shared\r\n```\r\nIn the opposite order, those commands would succeed.\r\n\r\nThe bug occurred because we checked the JSONValidationError for `type` or `anyOf`, but did not check and interpred `oneOf`. That is fixed in this PR.\r\n\r\nIncludes regression test.",
