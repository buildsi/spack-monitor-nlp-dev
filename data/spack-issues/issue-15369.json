    "body": "This PR adds a necessary dependency for the `jinja2` and `pytest` packages we already vendor. It also allows us to do fancy things in the `PythonPackage` base class, like automatically detect which libraries to try to import (coming in a follow-up PR).\r\n\r\nSetuptools includes a few vendored dependencies of its own (`appdirs`, `packaging`, `pyparsing`, `six`). We could remove these, or move them to `lib/spack/external`, but that would require hacking the setuptools code to import them normally.\r\n\r\nCloses #9034 \r\nFollow-up of #9261",
