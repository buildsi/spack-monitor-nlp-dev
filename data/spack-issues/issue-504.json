    "body": "Fixes #502.\n- Fix bug introduced during merge of stage refactor.\n  - install prefix was not created before build_environment.fork()\n    - build_environment.fork() calls setup_dependent_environment\n    - python's setup_dependent_environment can inadvertently create\n      the install prefix before directory_layout expects it.\n- Clean up Package.do_install:\n  - simplify control flow: parent process now entirely responsible for\n    creating/destroying the install prefix. cleanup is now in one place.\n  - Hoisting cleanup out of the child improves nesting of try/catch in\n    `real_work`.\n  - `real_work` renamed to `build_process`\n- also fixes race in `pango` install.\n",
