    "body": "Making building tests optional (variant `+test` in py-pybind11, now) prevents py-pybind11 from requiring py-test and its dependencies. Also since py-pybind11 is a header-only library, 99% of the build time is spent building the tests. Making that optional enables faster installation of py-pybind11.",
