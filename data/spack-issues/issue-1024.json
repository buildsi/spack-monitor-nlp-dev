    "body": "Tkinter is normally a default part of python. But, if the python installer in spack doesn't find Tk/Tcl in system locations, this module will be broken. To enable this module, I believe we can add dependencies on Tk and Tcl and configure arguments for python\n\n```\ndepends_on(\"tk\")\ndepends_on(\"tcl\")\n...\n\"--with-tcltk-includes=-I%s/include -I%s/include\" % ( spec['tk'].prefix, spec['tcl'].prefix ),\n\"--with-tcltk-libs=%s/lib %s/lib\" % ( spec['tk'].prefix, spec['tcl'].prefix )\n```\n\nI also needed to set `TCL_LIBRARY` and `TK_LIBRARY` in my environment, but it seems there should be a better way to point python to the Tk/tcl libraries.\n",
