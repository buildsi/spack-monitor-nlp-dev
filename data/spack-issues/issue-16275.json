    "body": "Currently petsc package activates cuda support when cuda is anywhere in the spec (i.e. `'cuda' in spec`). This is perhaps a bit surprising as it means cuda support will be built if you ask for `petsc~cuda ^openmpi+cuda`. \r\n\r\nThis patch changes the PETSc package to only build with cuda support when `petsc+cuda` is specified.
