    "body": "- Remove `depends_on('boost')`. It triggers an error : `Error: An unsatisfiable variant constraint has been detected for spec:` when `spack install hpx`. This is due to boost defaulting to cxxstd=98 whereas hpx requires at least 11. The error disappears when `spack install hpx cxxstd=11`.\r\n- Introduce a variant to opt-in building with tests. Default is to skip compiling tests.\r\n- Build HPX in parallel by default. If tests are not built, each process uses ~1Gb.",
