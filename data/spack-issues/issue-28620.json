    "body": "Some \"concrete\" versions on the command line, e.g. `qt@5` are really meant to satisfy some actual concrete version from a package. We should only assume the user is introducing a new, unknown version on the CLI if we, well, don't know of any version that satisfies the user's request.  So, if we know about `5.11.1` and `5.11.3` and they ask for `5.11.2`, we'd ask the solver to consider `5.11.2` as a solution.  If they just ask for `5`, though, `5.11.1` or `5.11.3` are fine solutions, as they satisfy `@5`, so use them.\r\n\r\n~~This is how the old concretizer behaved -- the new one was erroneously assuming that we needed to consider *every* CLI version on its own.~~ This is sadly new behavior, so it needs to be added to the next version (0.18.0).\r\n\r\n- [x] fix version logic in `asp.py`\r\n- [x] test",
