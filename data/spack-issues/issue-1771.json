    "body": "It turns out, everything works with binutils@2.26.  It is good that one version of binutils can work for everything... Spack is capable (in theory, not yet practice) of using different binutils for different packages.  But traditional systems (MacPorts, RPM, etc) are not really.  So it is comforting that we can use just one version of binutils for everything.\n\nThis PR resolves #1506\n",
