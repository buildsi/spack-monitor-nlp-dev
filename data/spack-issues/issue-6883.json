    "body": "I found, that libharu would not build on the current develop branch of spack, due to missing commands at build time. This is fixed by adding libtool, autoconf and automake as build-time dependencies.\r\n\r\nHowever, I doubt that this is the correct approach. The package class inherits from AutotoolsPackage, should it thus not also inherit these dependencies?",
