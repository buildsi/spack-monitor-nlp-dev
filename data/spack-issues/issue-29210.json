Since it is getting the *package class* as opposed to a *package instance* what the test is asserting is the presence of a property on the class. A simple reproducer of the behavior below:\r\n```python\r\nSpack version 0.17.1\r\nPython 3.8.10, Linux x86_64\r\n>>> import spack.repo\r\n>>> zlib = spack.repo.path.get_pkg_class('zlib')\r\n>>> type(zlib)\r\n<class 'spack.package.PackageMeta'>\r\n>>> zlib.installed\r\n<property object at 0x7f2612bf1090>\r\n>>> assert zlib.installed\r\n>>> bool(zlib.installed)\r\nTrue\r\n```\n\n### Error message\n\nThere is no error message, but the assertions in the test are wrong, since they don't check if a package object is installed or not - they check if the package class has a true-ish attribute defined.\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-1358-5d46e5856c\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.10\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-icelake\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
