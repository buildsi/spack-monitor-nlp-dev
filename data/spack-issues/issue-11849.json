    "body": "This addresses two issue found when trying to build boost with XL as:\r\n```\r\n$ spack install boost@1.69 %xl\r\n```\r\nbzip2 issues:\r\n- xl does not support `-fpic`. `-fPIC` is supported.\r\n- nvcc does not support absolute paths to shared objects. Requires `-L. -l:<lib>` syntax.\r\n\r\nboost issues:\r\n- boost.thread uses decltype and therefore requires the c++11 standard. Modern xlC versions seem not to default to C++11.\r\n\r\nThis is my first contribution to spack, so I would appreciate any suggestions to improve it. Thanks!",
