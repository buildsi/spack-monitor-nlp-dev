    "body": "I receive this warning when installing LLVM on OS X:\n\n```\n==> Warning: There is no checksum on file to fetch python@2.7 safely.\n  Fetch anyway? [y/N] ^CTraceback (most recent call last):\n```\n\nSpack is trying to install Python 2.7 (not 2.7.x). When I answer \"yes\", the download succeeds, but the build ultimately fails for unrelated reasons. Spack should not be installing this version; it should install 2.7.11 instead.\n\nI assume this might be because LLVM requires `depends_on('python@2.7:2.8')`, and Spack resolves this to Python 2.7 instead of Python 2.7.11?\n",
