    "body": "In the builtin package for numpy, when using intel, a check of the\r\nunderlying gcc version is performed. This breaks spack in a pristine\r\nenvironment as spack does not load compiler modules during the setup\r\nphase of building a module. There is no clean work around for this\r\nand so we'll just rip out the check. If an environment is incorporating\r\ngcc < 4.8 then there are likely larger issues, anyway.",
