    "body": "This PR simplifies the template that describes the process of reporting a build error for a Spack package. It removes a lot of debugging things that I don't believe are particularly useful, and adds several new things. The simpler the process is, the more likely users are to fill in the template instead of ignoring it.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add an initial title to make sure things stay uniform\r\n- [x] Replace `spack --version` with the new `spack debug report`\r\n- [x] Request that users upload `spack-build-out.txt` and `spack-build-env.txt`\r\n- [x] Request that users @mention maintainers",
