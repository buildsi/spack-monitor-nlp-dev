    "body": "Just noticed this interesting behavior. I deleted my `compilers.yaml` and `spack compiler find` created a new one that looks like:\r\n```yaml\r\ncompilers:\r\n- compiler:\r\n    environment: {}\r\n    extra_rpaths: []\r\n    flags: {}\r\n    modules: []\r\n    operating_system: sierra\r\n    paths:\r\n      cc: !!python/unicode '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/clang'\r\n      cxx: !!python/unicode '/Library/Developer/CommandLineTools/usr/bin/clang++'\r\n      f77: /usr/local/bin/gfortran\r\n      fc: /usr/local/bin/gfortran\r\n    spec: clang@8.1.0-apple\r\n    target: x86_64\r\n```\r\nI'm going to investigate why it adds these `!!python/unicode` strings. Just wanted to report it so I can keep track of the bug.",
