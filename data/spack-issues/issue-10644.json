    "body": "By default, pkgconf and pkg-config strip out system paths. This can cause problems because Spack sets `CPATH`, which is taken into account when determining the system paths.\r\n\r\nThe difference of this change can be tested with: `spack build-env gettext -- pkg-config --cflags libxml-2.0`\r\n\r\nBefore this change, the output should be empty because the libxml2 package explicitly sets `CPATH`, which causes pkgconf and pkg-config to strip out its include directory. After this change, the output should contain the include directory.",
