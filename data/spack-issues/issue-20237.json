    "body": "closes #20232 \r\n\r\n`cmake @3.17:` is necessary to handle `cuda @11:` correctly. Earlier versions of `cmake` do not know that `cuda @11:` does not support `compute_30` any more, and list that compute capability as supported. This is handled in `cmake`'s file `Modules/FindCUDA/select_compute_arch.cmake`.",
