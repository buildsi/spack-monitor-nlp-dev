    "body": "The \"capability\" tests we have planned through pavilion2 are asynchronous using the resource manager, so we have to have separate commands for launching, checking on, and getting results from tests.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds `run`, `list`, `status`, and `results` subcommands to the `spack test` command. The `run` command is all that is necessary for the smoke tests, but the other commands are still valid.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds all other components necessary to make the separate commands work in the smoke-test case.",
