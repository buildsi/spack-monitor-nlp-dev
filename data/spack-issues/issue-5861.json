    "body": "~~**NOT MERGE READY** I figured out an `lmod`ism that needs to get added in here, the TCL modules only worked because `setup-env.sh` addes that to `MODULEPATH`.  Will strike through this after next commit later tonight, see [comment below](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/5861#issuecomment-338484869).~~\r\n\r\nProvides an explanation of how to setup a spack installed llvm properly using modules as well as suggestions for choosing a fortran compiler to couple with it.\r\n\r\n1. I lack the ability to be succinct / trim down the fat.  Maintainers can edit the branch directly, as well as I'm happy to apply any / all suggestions.\r\n2. Since the docs take eons to build, ~~[here is an `html.zip`](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/1403868/html.zip)~~ [here is an LMOD updated `html.zip`](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/files/1405637/html.zip) of the local docs build for viewing convenience.  Extract and `open html/getting_started.html`.  The anchor point is `getting_started.html#case-study-spack-installed-llvm-with-modules-and-mixed-toolchains`.\r\n\r\nFixes #5817.\r\n\r\n@davydden I put it just below that section on its own, since it requires both modules and a mixed toolchain.  Does that make sense?\r\n\r\n@junghans any special wisdom about `flang` here?  It's talked about in \"Step 4\".",
