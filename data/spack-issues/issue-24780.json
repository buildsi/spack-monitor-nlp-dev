    "body": "Jupyterlab (already 2.2.7) did not start up but only showed an error message because it was looking for its application directory inside the python prefix instead its own one. This was fixed by setting the according environment variable.\r\n\r\nThe upgrade from jupyterlab version 2 to 3 introduced a lot of new dependencies. This pull request therefor depends on\r\n#24751\r\n#24753 \r\n#24777 with implicit #24764, #24765\r\n#24778\r\n#24779\r\n",
