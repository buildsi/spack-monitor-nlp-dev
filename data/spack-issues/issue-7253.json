It is nearly 900 characters). -DMATH_LIBS isn't anything LMOD knows what to do with, so loading elemental fails.\r\n\r\nUsed spack 819ceb4f6dc0bd6a3b68df28f54f19ca0ad368ae, which is current. Occurred on a spack version from month ago as well, don't know which.\r\n\r\nInstalled with `spack install elemental %gcc@4.9.3`, on ppc64le, tried to load with `spack load elemental`\r\n\r\nModule file:\r\n[module.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/1732033/module.txt)\r\n",
