I report this as a bug because as long as I could see on the documentation, such type of spec. to be used to resolve versions is not specified.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nmariano@mariano-HP-Pavilion-15-Notebook-PC:~$ spack load py-mpi4py\r\n### Error Message\r\n==> Error: py-mpi4py matches multiple packages.\r\n  Matching packages:\r\n    sznaq64 py-mpi4py@3.0.3%gcc@7.5.0 arch=linux-ubuntu18.04-skylake\r\n    kbd7nic py-mpi4py@3.0.3%gcc@7.5.0 arch=linux-ubuntu18.04-skylake\r\n  Use a more specific spec.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n$ uname -a \r\nLinux mariano-HP-Pavilion-15-Notebook-PC 5.3.0-42-generic #34~18.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Fri Feb 28 13:42:26 UTC 2020 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n$ lsb_release -d\r\nDescription:\tUbuntu 18.04.4 LTS",
