    "body": "I have a shared team location for a spack mirror.  I ran into a problem last night when I noticed our axom@develop mirrored tarball had not been updated since May.  This is especially bad considering there is no way to notice this until a new feature or bug fix is needed from a dependency you track via a git branch.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack create mirror -d /mirror/directory serac@develop%gcc\r\n// notice time stamp on /mirror/directory/axom/develop.tar.gz\r\n// do some change to axom's git develop branch\r\n$ spack create mirror -d /some/local/directory serac@develop%gcc\r\n// notice the time stamp on /mirror/directory/axom/develop.tar.gz has not changed\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Workaround\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack create mirror -d /mirror/directory serac@develop%gcc\r\n// notice time stamp on /mirror/directory/axom/develop.tar.gz\r\n// do some change to axom's git develop branch\r\n$ rm -rf /mirror/directory/axom/develop.tar.gz /mirror/directory/_source-cache/git/LLNL/axom.git/develop.tar.gz\r\n$ spack create mirror -d /some/local/directory serac@develop%gcc\r\n// notice the time stamp on /mirror/directory/axom/develop.tar.gz has changed\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
