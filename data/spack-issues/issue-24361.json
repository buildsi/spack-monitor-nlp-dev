    "body": "This PR fixes a couple of issues with the opencv package, mostly in\r\nrelation to cuda. This is only focused on cuda, not any of the other\r\nvariants.\r\n- Added versions to the contrib_vers list. Added for all that can be\r\n  retrieved from github. The one for the latest version was missing.\r\n- Added a cmake patch for v3.2.0.\r\n- Deprecated versions 3.1.0 and 3.2.0 as neither of those could be\r\n  built, with or without cuda.\r\n- Adjusted constraints on applying initial cmake patch.\r\n- Added cudnn dependency when +cuda.\r\n- Set constraints for cudnn and cuda for older versions of opencv.",
