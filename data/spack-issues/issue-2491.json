    "body": "The changes in this pull request fix an undefined variable bug in the `fontconfig` package (which was previously causing the install script to crash on some platforms) and modernize the string substitution methods used in this package.  I've verified that the `fontconfig %gcc@4.7.2 arch=linux-rhel6-x86_64` variant of this package installs properly.\r\n\r\n@hartzell: Could you verify that this updated version of `fontconfig` still works for you when you get a chance?  Thanks in advance for your help.",
