    "body": "This PR does two things:\r\n1. Add `from __future__ import absolute_import` to every package.py load, so that we can support a package named Spack in a module name spack. Thanks a bunch @sethrj for figuring this one out!\r\n2. Add a package name `spack`, as an alternative bootstrapping method. In particular this allows us to express conflicts with Python, which is useful for all current releases, because of Python's recent breaking API change to urllib.",
