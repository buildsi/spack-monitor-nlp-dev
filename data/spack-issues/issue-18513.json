    "body": "Sending the `SPACK_REPO` variable from the multi-project trigger (like we were doing before this PR) overrode any value set in the project.  In order to get pipelines to clone spack from the gitlab mirror instead of github (hopefully reducing EC2 networking costs), we need to either set the cluster-internal gitlab url here or remove `SPACK_REPO` from here.  I went with removing `SPACK_REPO` since it seemed slightly cleaner.",
