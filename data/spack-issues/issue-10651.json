    "body": "Fixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/10550\r\n\r\nThe following allows for environment configs like\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  specs:\r\n    - python@3.6.1\r\n  packages::                 <--- note the double colon\r\n    python:\r\n      variants: +optimizations\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpack environments use the `ruaml.yaml` library to read/write `yaml` in a manner that preserves comments, but Spack's own yaml reader contains logic specifically for allowing a `::` for any dictionary key to override a section.\r\n\r\nThis validates environment configuration by reading it in as a `spack_yaml` object, but preserves it as a `ruaml.yaml` object when it is being manipulated.",
