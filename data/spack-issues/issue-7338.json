    "body": "'''Add support to build OpenSpeedShop and CBTF components on Cray platform with changes for other components in order to support the building of OpenSpeedShop.   The build is done in two steps:\r\nFirst build the compute node components:\r\n         spack install cbtf-krell%gcc@7.2.0 +runtime+mpich os=CNL\r\nThen build the login node components:\r\n         spack install openspeedshop%gcc@7.2.0 +crayfe+mpich+cbtf os=sles12\r\n\r\nThe login node components depend on the installation paths for several of the compute node components.  This is where these changes depend on a intermediate solution to that problem based on @scheibelp direction.\r\n'''",
