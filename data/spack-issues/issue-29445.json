    "body": "Ipopt changed their configure flags for dependencies from version 3.13.0 and onwards (see changelogs [here](https://github.com/coin-or/Ipopt/blob/stable/3.14/ChangeLog.md), under 3.13.0). Currently, this seems to be partially accounted for for Lapack, but not for other dependencies. This caused, for instance, Ipopt to silently be built without support for Mumps even when +mumps was specified for me.\r\n\r\nAlso, the configure flags for Metis seem to have been removed in 3.13.0 as well. Presumably, Metis reordering support is handled by just linking with a linear solver configured to use it.",
