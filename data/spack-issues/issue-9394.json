    "body": "I attempted to run 2 `spack install`s simultaneously.  I thought that the packages to be built by the commands were entirely disjoint sets, but it turned out that a recent `git pull`  pulled in a newer version of cmake (which is required by both commands).  So the first `spack install` began building the new cmake and the second `spack install` blocked waiting on the completion of that install.  Once the first `spack install` built and installed cmake, I believe that the second `spack install` began immediately building and installing cmake, causing the following warning from the first `spack install`:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Successfully installed cmake\r\n  Fetch: 7.85s.

I believe the second `spack install` left the cmake installation in an OK state.  I assume nothing bad happened with the corrupt cmake installation because the package dependent on cmake (i.e., jansson) was not rebuilt by spack and the already installed version used.  I also assume this was caused by the parallel execution of the `spack install`s, but maybe something else caused it.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\nspack install flux-sched@master # in tmux pane 1\r\nspack install flux-sched@master ^boost@1.53 # in tmux pane 2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nSee above messages in summary\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\n 1. which platform you are using: Quartz at LLNL - TOSS3",
