    "body": "The perl binary can also be called `perlX.Y.Z` if using a development build or simply using the versioned binary.\r\n\r\nWe were also dropping all sbang arguments, since `exec $interpreter_v` was only using the first element of the `interpreter_v` array.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the underlying problem of #14536. We should still apply #14536 to be on the safe side, though.",
