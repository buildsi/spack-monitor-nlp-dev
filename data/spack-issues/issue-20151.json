    "body": "As part of pull request #19452, a patch method was added to the mfem\r\npackage to delete byte order marks from 3 mfem source files. These\r\nfiles first appeared in a stable release of mfem as of version\r\n4.1. Consequently, attempts to install mfem 3.4 or mfem 4.0 fail\r\nbecause no files exist at the path arguments of the filter_file\r\ncommands used to execute this operation. Decorating the patch method\r\nso it runs only on mfem versions 4.1 and later resolves the errors\r\nthat were thrown due to files not found.\r\n\r\nThis commit adds that decorator.",
