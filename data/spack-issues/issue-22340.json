I would love to deprecate OpenCV 3 as well, but a ton of Spack packages depend on OpenCV 3. Many of the optional 3rd party components are missing required dependencies. I haven't tested any of them, but I enabled a CMake option that will cause the build to fail if the dependencies aren't found. If anyone needs them, they should test them out and possibly add dependencies and/or CMake flags.\r\n\r\n@bvanessen ",
