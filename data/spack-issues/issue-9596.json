Therefore, to build newer versions of `atk`, you must specify their version on the command line, e.g. `spack install atk@2.28.1`. More on this at https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/8133#issuecomment-389378055\r\n\r\nAnd this now also allows `spack install py-pygtk to succeed`.\r\n\r\nSee: https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/9102#issuecomment-431514107",
