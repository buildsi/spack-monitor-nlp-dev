    "body": "Fixes #14416.\r\n\r\n* Allows `spack.config.InternalConfigScope` and `spack.config.Configuration.set()` to handle keys with trailing ':' to indicate replacement vs merge behavior with respect to lower priority scopes.\r\n* Lists may now be replaced rather than merged (this behavior was previously only available for dictionaries).\r\n* Tests of the new behavior.\r\n* In `spack.config._merge_yaml()`:\r\n  * New optional Boolean argument `override` for use in nested contexts.\r\n  * Minor logic improvements and simplification.",
