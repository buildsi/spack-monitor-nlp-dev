    "body": "We are seeing an uptick in the number of people wanting to use PMIx in Python libraries and applications. I'm not sure of your distribution policies, but it might be worth considering enabling the Python bindings in the PMIx package.\r\n\r\nBuilding the bindings requires Cython (in the standard locations for the Python being used) plus addition of the `--enable-python-bindings` configure option. It will generate an \"egg\" that is installed in the prefix location - this would have to be added to the rpm or whatever method you choose for distributing it.",
