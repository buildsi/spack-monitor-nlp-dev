    "body": "Some corner cases pop up during installs with `spack develop` specs where the develop spec's are no longer registered as installed in the database.  From conversations on slack there seems to be triggered through some incremental builds.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to trace down what causes the spec to be listed as `uninstalled`, adding another conditional to the check for installed specs allows spack to recover and reinstall the develop specs properly.",
