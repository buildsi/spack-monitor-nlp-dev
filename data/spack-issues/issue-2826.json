    "body": "I am somewhat apprehensive with a full-blown `llvm` dependency, but to the best of my understanding [`ispc`](https://github.com/ispc/ispc) definitively requires the `llvm` codebase.\r\n\r\nThe `ignore_libtinfo.patch` is because their makefile is too zealous, and the second patch *appears* to be working but I have literally no idea how to test it since I don't actually know how to use `ispc` (yet!).\r\n\r\nI opened [an issue](https://github.com/ispc/ispc/issues/1251) about the NVPTX stuff, but I'm pretty sure the patch I made works assuming the previous code base did.  The second patch is just adding a bunch of `ifdef` stuff they did elsewhere in the file because the `llvm` functions changed between versions.",
