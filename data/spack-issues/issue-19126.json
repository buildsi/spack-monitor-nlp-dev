    "body": "I have a spack environment described in a spack.yaml file. This file includes the following entry:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack:\r\n  ...\r\n  repos:\r\n  - /ccs/home/mdorier1/sds-repo # adds the mochi namespace to spack\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis external repository is known to this environment, but is not in my `~/.spack/repos.yaml` file, which allows me to use it within the environment without making it global to all environments.\r\n\r\nWhen I call `spack env deactivate` to deactivate this environment however, I am getting the following warning message.\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Warning: Unknown namespace: mochi\r\n==> Warning: Could not fully deactivate view due to missing package or repo, shell environment may be corrupt.\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think spack should be able to take this scenario into account and properly deactivate the environment even if it uses an external repo.",
