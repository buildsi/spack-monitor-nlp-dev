    "body": "The singluarity package ([a WIP here](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/11094#issuecomment-484274715)) would like to print out a helpful message to the user after the installation (suggesting that they chown some files to `root` and make one of them `setuid`).\r\n\r\nThere doesn't seem to be any way to do this.  I've tried overriding various installation steps and/or wrapping them, to no avail.  I eventually figured out that the output was going to the log file, not the terminal.\r\n\r\nThe cleanest solution that I've come up with is to add a *hook*, e.g. `lib/spack/spack/hooks/post_install_message.py` that checks whether a package implements a method named `post_install_message` and calls the method if so.\r\n\r\n```python\r\n # Copyright 2013-2019 Lawrence Livermore National Security, LLC and other\r\n # Spack Project Developers.
