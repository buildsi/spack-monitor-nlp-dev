    "body": "Some packages like \u2018perf\u2019 on Linux must be matched closely by the Kernel version because they depend on the Kernel API. Spack currently doesn\u2019t have a way to express these dependencies, making it difficult to package tools like \u2018perf\u2019 or higher level tools that depend upon it. \r\n\r\nUntil spack can build these tools natively, it would be nice to have an \u201cexternal-only\u201d package which can only be added via external find.  Ideally this would be marked somehow in the package.py file. I see this as an extension of the functionality that exists in package.yaml.\r\n\r\nI talked to @cosmicexplorer about this on Slack. ",
