It apparently has some support NUnit format so we could start by adding a few fields to the current test format. What do people think of that?\r\n\r\nand later\r\n\r\n> @alalazo: do you want this merged now to update NUnit later,...\r\n\r\n\r\nI don't know about possible options  (I only have some experience with CDash for C++ project with CMake), but my understanding from the two comments above is that one `NUnit` format is supported, we could start collecting build logs in CDash.\r\n\r\np.s. relevant to https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/2014",
