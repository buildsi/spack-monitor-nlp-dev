    "body": "Some variables like TERM and DISPLAY are convenient when dropping a shell in the build env, but are unset in the build environment.\n\nNow we can preserve them with `spack build-env --tty zlib -- bash`\n\nI was thinking whether `spack build-env --tty zlib` without a command should just open a shell, but if `build-env` mimicks `env` that's feature creep.\n\nOne issue though is that `spack build-env --tty zlib -- bash` may find a bash built by spack. `.. -- /bin/bash` or `.. -- $SHELL` would solve that.\n",
