    "body": "If the user has set the environment variable `VISUAL`, it will be used in preference to `EDITOR` for all Spack editing activities. If `VISUAL` is not set or fails (perhaps due to a lack of graphical editing capabilities),`EDITOR` will be used instead. We fall back to one of several common editors if neither bears fruit.\r\n\r\nThis feature has been tailored to:\r\n* Provide identical behavior to the previous implementation in the case that `VISUAL` is not set.\r\n* Not require any change to code utilizing the editor feature.\r\n* Follow usual UNIX behavior concerning `VISUAL` and `EDITOR`.",
