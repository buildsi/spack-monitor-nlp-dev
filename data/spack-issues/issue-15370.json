    "body": "Previously, users were required to override `import_modules` for every PythonPackage that they wanted import tests for. Now, we automatically locate module files and packages. Users can still override `import_modules` for weird cases.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Automatically detect `import_modules`\r\n- [ ] Remove no longer needed `import_modules` from packages\r\n- [ ] Update PythonPackage documentation\r\n\r\nNote that these `import_module_test`s now exist for all 850+ PythonPackages in Spack, and these tests can be run after installation has already finished, making these great smoke tests for existing Spack installations.",
