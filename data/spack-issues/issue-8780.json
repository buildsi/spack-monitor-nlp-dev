    "body": "As a user I want the bash completion file always synchronized with the current set of commands and options, so that I won't receive wrong suggestions when pressing <kbd>Tab</kbd>.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nRight now Spack has a completion file for bash that is manually maintained. As such it's very likely to go out of sync with the current set of commands and options. A simple improvement to this state of things could be:\r\n\r\n1. Have a way to generate that file automatically (the procedure might be a script, or a Spack command triggered manually by a contributor).\r\n2. Run a test during CI that checks if the content of the completion file needs an update (and fails in that case).\r\n\r\nMore sophisticated options could be relying on something like [argcomplete](http://argcomplete.readthedocs.io/en/latest/), though this might trigger some incompatibilities between our custom version of `argparse` and the standard one the package expects.\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart @tgamblin @scheibelp @healther ",
