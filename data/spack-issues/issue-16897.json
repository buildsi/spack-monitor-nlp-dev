    "body": "There is a bug in the implementation of specs as constraints that adds the sigil multiple times if multiple references in a list require sigil replacement. This leads to spec parsing errors (parsing `%%` or similar).\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack:\r\n  definitions:\r\n  - gccs: [gcc@9.0.0]\r\n  - pgis: [pgi@19.2]\r\n  - compiler_constraints: [$%gccs, $%pgis]\r\n  specs:\r\n  - $gccs\r\n  - $pgis\r\n  - matrix:\r\n    - [zlib]\r\n    - [$compiler_constraints]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the recursion problem by only applying the sigil to the part of the list currently being expanded.",
