    "body": "Add a mixing class for direct `CNAME`s to sourceforge mirrors. Since the main gateway servers are often down, this could reduce timeouts and fetch errors for sourceforge.net hosted software.\r\n\r\nI only added about half of the sourceforge.net powered packages, since others had more complex URLs or did not pass my fetch-and-checksum tests without further manual intervention.",
