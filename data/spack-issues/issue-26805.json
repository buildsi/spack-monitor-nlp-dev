    "body": "Currently the legion build system fetches a known compatible version of gasnet, builds it itself, and uses it as a dependency. To do this, it fetches the file as part of the cmake command\r\n\r\nThis PR makes that dependency explicit in the form of a `resource()` so that it will be captured in spack mirrors for the purposes of building and deploying on machines with restrictive firewalls that may block direct access to github",
