    "body": "Previously, we were comparing `HEAD` to `develop`. This included any files that had changed in develop, not in the branch. Now we only run `flake8` on files that have changed since branching off of develop.\r\n\r\nThis is the way we did things back in the [`share/spack/qa/changed_files`](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/commit/679f787a65bf4d8b3aa0c7931da7771bb0b8fb1e#diff-6b732c2181baaac0da9423213df300f7) days.
