    "body": "This PR has several modifications for the r package.\r\n\r\n- The tk package is always depended on but this pulls in X11, making the\r\n  'X' variant non-functional. This PR sets a dependency of tk on '+X'.\r\n- There is a missing dependency on libxmu when '+X' is set.\r\n- The libraries for R wind up in a non-standard location and are thus\r\n  left out of the RPATH settings. This PR adds that directory to RPATH.\r\n- The MKL integer interface for gfortran is not in the BLAS libs. This\r\n  PR replaces the intel interface with the gfortran interface if needed.\r\n- Use the `LibraryList` `ld_flags` method for blas as that is more in\r\n  line with th R Installation and Administration manual.\r\n\r\nNote that this PR depends on PR #11956. This PR closes #8642.",
