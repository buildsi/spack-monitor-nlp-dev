    "body": "Fixes #22643.\r\n\r\nAutoconf before 2.70 will erroneously pass `ifx`'s -loopopt argument to the linker, requiring all packages to use autoconf 2.70 or newer to use `ifx`.\r\n\r\nThis is a hotfix enabling `ifx` to be used in Spack. Instead of bothering to upgrade autoconf for every package, we'll just strip out the problematic flag if we're in `ld` mode.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a conditional to the `cc` wrapper to skip `-loopopt` in `ld` mode. This can probably be generalized in the future to strip more things (e.g., via an environment variable we can constrol from Spack) but it's good enough for now.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a test ensuring that `-loopopt` arguments are stripped in link mode, but not in compile mode.",
