It can be extended to work for other shells.\r\n\r\nProgress:\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix bug in superclass initialization in `ArgparseWriter`\r\n- [x] Refactor `ArgparseWriter` (see below)\r\n- [x] Ensure that output of old `--format` options remains the same\r\n- [x] Add `ArgparseCompletionWriter` and `BashCompletionWriter`\r\n- [x] Add `--aliases` option to add command aliases\r\n- [x] Standardize positional argument names\r\n- [x] Tests for `spack commands --format=bash` coverage\r\n- [x] Tests to make sure `spack-completion.bash` stays up-to-date\r\n- [x] Tests for `spack-completion.bash` coverage\r\n- [x] Speed up `spack-completion.bash` by caching subroutine calls\r\n\r\nThings I would like to save for future PRs:\r\n\r\n- Support for other shells, like zsh (#2356) and fish (@JBlaschke)\r\n- Fix BrokenPipeError for `spack commands --format=rst | head` in Python 3 (see [comment](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/14393#discussion_r365549793))\r\n- Docs?\r\n\r\nThis PR also necessitates a significant refactoring of `ArgparseWriter`. Previously, `ArgparseWriter` was mostly a single `_write` method which handled everything from extracting the information we care about from the parser to formatting the output. Now, `_write` only handles recursion, while the information extraction is split into a separate `parse` method, and the formatting is handled by `format`. This allows subclasses to completely redefine how the format will appear without overriding all of `_write`.",
