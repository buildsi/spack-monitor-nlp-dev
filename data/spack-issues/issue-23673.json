    "body": "Currently post-installation tests are usually run inside the install prefix and must be cleaned before reusing. I suggest a mechanism for running inside a temporary directory.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nInstallation tests, especially for libraries, can be messy (e.g. create a `build` dir with many files), and the result of one build might affect another build resulting in a false positive or negative.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it's possible that users of a shared spack installation other than the original installer would want to test, or spack is installed onto a read-only device. Currently the test system assumes the user testing has full write privileges on the installation prefix.\r\n\r\nFinally, packages might `make clean` the test builds to avoid polluting the next run or leaving detritus in the installation directories, but that behavior interferes with the ability to debug a smoke test if it fails. The better solution is a temporary directory with a `--keep-stage` option.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI think a `self.test_build_dir` or something could easily replace the handrolled smoke test \"build\" dirs in place.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] Spack version 0.16.1-2652-39a4f3ba88\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
