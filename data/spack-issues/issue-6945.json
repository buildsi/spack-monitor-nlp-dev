    "body": "Fixes #6857.\r\n\r\n- Generating the HTML from for >2300 packages from RST in Sphinx seems to\r\n  take forever.\r\n- Add an option to `spack list` to generate straight HTML instead.\r\n- This reduces the doc build time to about a minute from over 5 minutes on my mac.\r\n\r\nI'd really like to get rid of the package list altogether and have a searchable site for packages (like the brew formula page).  But that will take longer and this was an easy fix.\r\n",
