    "body": "It takes ages for any patches for libtool to get accepted, merged and released (if at all). This PR introduces version `@develop` with all prerequisites for bootstrapping. It should be noted that the releases can be and must be bootstrapped (with flag `--force`) if any patches are applied to them. So, I suggest that we have only one version `@develop` for any patches that we would like to have. This will also be easier to maintain them: no need to check if a patch works for any other version.\r\n\r\nThe first patch, which is included in this PR, fixes incorrect parsing of additional linking flags appended by a compiler. The comment in `libtool.m4` says that \r\n\r\n> Some  compilers place space between \"-{L,R}\" and the path.\r\n\r\nbut the logic implemented after the comment doesn't actually work. The patch fixes that as well as extends it for the flag `-l` too. For example, Cray's compiler wrapper `ftn` adds `-l gfortran` (instead of `-lgfortran`), which confuses `libtool`.",
