    "body": "### Summary\n\n`packages.yaml` does not allow for env variables in external python spec. For example:\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n  python:\r\n    buildable: false\r\n    externals:\r\n    - spec: python@3.7.11\r\n      prefix: $CONDA_PREFIX\r\n```\r\nWhen doing a `spack install` for a spack environment which has a `py-` package that depends on this external python in conda, the current spack developer version will error out:\r\n```\r\n==> Error: RuntimeError: Unable to locate python command in $CONDA_PREFIX/bin\r\n\r\n/scratch/gpfs/rmc2/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/python/package.py:663, in command:\r\n        660                return Executable(path)\r\n        661        else:\r\n        662            msg = 'Unable to locate {0} command in {1}'\r\n  >>    663            raise RuntimeError(msg.format(self.name, self.prefix.bin))\r\n```\r\nThis is because in package.py, there is only a `os.path.exists`, and not an `os.path.expandvars` call. Could put in directly, or use `canonicalize_path` from `path.py` perhaps.\r\n\r\nIn general, a section of the documentation discussing using conda and spack in tandem would be useful. I often find most conda packages are OK, but there are a few which I need to build from source on e.g. `pplc64` architectures, and it would be useful to document clearly that spack+conda use case (I think it is spread across various parts of the documentation currently, but laying it out explicitly would be useful from my p.o.v) \n\n### Rationale\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
