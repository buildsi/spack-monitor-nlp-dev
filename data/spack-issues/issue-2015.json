    "body": "This is a long-standing bug but I'm just getting around to reporting it. Let's say you install 3 things:\n1. `hdf5~mpi`\n2. `hdf5+mpi ^mvapich2`\n3. `hdf5+mpi ^openmpi`\n\nIf you run `spack find -vd hdf5`, you get all 3. If you run `spack find -vd hdf5+mpi`, you get 2 and 3. If you run `spack find -vd hdf5+mpi ^openmpi`, you only get 3. This is the expected behavior.\n\nBut, if you run `spack find -vd hdf5 ^openmpi`, you get 1 and 3, even though 1 doesn't depend on openmpi. Even if you run `spack find -vd hdf5~mpi ^openmpi`, it still gives you 1 when it should return none.\n\nSimilarly, if you run `spack uninstall -a hdf5 ^openmpi`, it will ask if you want to uninstall 1 and 3, making uninstalls require the use of a hash.\n",
