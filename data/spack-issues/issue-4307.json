    "body": "I spent the last couple of days studying the code that implements repositories (and I have to say it has been quite instructive to see how it blends into the python \"import\" protocol). While I was at it I thought it could have been a good exercise to refactor some parts to be more \"pythonic\"  hence this PR.\r\n\r\nThe modifications here involve just `RepoPath`, as I would like to keep the PR as focused as possible. If there's agreement on the type of changes I will start having a look at `Repo` and `NamespaceTrie` in other PRs (in case they need any change).\r\n\r\nLet me know if you agree with these kind of PRs or if you can figure out further tests besides the ones implemented.\r\n\r\nFixes #4236 \r\nFixes #5002",
