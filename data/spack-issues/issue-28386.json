    "body": "Adds @scheibelp and @varioustoxins to the list of maintainers for our Python recipe. You'll likely get pinged on many issues/PRs related to Python. Feel free to ignore them unless they involve Python 2 or are a big change that is worth testing on Python 2. Although you're welcome to fix/review things related to Python 3 if you have time. Thanks for your help!\r\n\r\nOnce this is merged, I'll revert #28003. I'll likely still deprecate 3.1.5 just because we know it won't work once #28346 is merged (requires sysconfig which was added in 2.7/3.2). Other than that, I'm fine with keeping all other Python versions.",
