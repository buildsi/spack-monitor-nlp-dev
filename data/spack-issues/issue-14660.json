    "body": "It's often useful to run a module with `python -m`, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ python -m pyinstrument script.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nRunning a python script this way was hard, though, as `spack python` did not have a similar `-m` option.  This PR adds a `-m` option to `spack python` so that we can do things like this:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack python -m pyinstrument ./test.py\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis makes it easy to write a script that uses a small part of Spack and then profile it.  Previously thee easiest way to do this was to write a custom Spack command, which is often overkill.\r\n\r\n- [x] add `-m` option to `spack python`\r\n- [x] tests",
