    "body": "Adds several patches necessary to build Tar with PGI 16.10. With these patches in place, `make check` passes with flying colors for me on CentOS 6.8.\r\n\r\nIf `config-pgi.patch` looks familiar, that's because it's the same patch from #3044 and #501. `config.in.h`, `gnu/se-selinux.in.h`, and `gnu/argp-pin.c` all come from Gnulib, the GNU Portability Library. Gnulib is not distributed in releases; it is intended to be copied into the tarball for a package. Unfortunately, this means that I'll have to add similar patches for other packages as well. Luckily, Gnulib is being patched permanently each time, so we shouldn't expect these bugs in newer releases.",
