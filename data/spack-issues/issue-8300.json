    "body": "Closes #8290.\r\nThe newer version of libjpeg-turbo installs the relevant libraries in lib64 and not lib. Since the newer version of libjpeg-turbo is now the preferred version, this will work. If someone wants to install an older libjpeg-turbo and install py-pillow, this won't work. \r\n\r\nWhile one can set up an if statement for dependencies in spack, I'm unsure about how one would check where jpeg is getting picked up from and if it is coming from libjpeg-turbo<1.5.90, then change the lib64 to lib.
