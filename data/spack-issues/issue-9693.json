    "body": "scikit-learn depends on python, numpy and scipy.  Exactly which versions of these dependencies are acceptable depends on the version of scikit-learn being installed.\r\n\r\nThis commit changes the depends_on() calls to specify the versions of both the dependency and scikit-learn.  Also, it adds a build dependency on py-setuptools.\r\n\r\nFinally, this commit removes v0.13.1.  This version dates back to 2013, doesn't work with Python v3.x and even with Python 2.7, fails to build due to errors with setup.py.",
