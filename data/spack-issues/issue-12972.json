    "body": "Closes #11783.\r\n\r\n@michaelkuhn: I think this accomplishes what #11783 set out to do, but in a much simpler way.\r\n\r\nThe Python landscape is going to be changing in 2020, and Python 2 will be end of life. Spack should *prefer* Python 3 to Python 2 by default, but we still need to run on systems that only have Python2 available.\r\n\r\nThis is trickier than it sounds, as on some systems, the `python` command is `python2`; on others it's `python3`, and [RHEL8 doesn't even have the `python` command](https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2018/11/14/python-in-rhel-8/).  Instead, it makes you choose `python3` or `python2`. You can thus no longer make a simple shebang to handle all the cases.\r\n\r\nThis commit makes the `spack` script bilingual.  It is still valid Python, but its shebang is `#!/bin/sh`, and it has a tiny bit of shell code at the beginning to pick the right python and execute itself with what it finds.\r\n\r\nThis has a lot of advantages.  I think this will help ensure that Spack works well in Python3 -- there are cases where we've missed things because Python2 is still the default `python` on most systems.  Also, with this change, you do not lose the ability to execute the `spack` script directly with a python interpreter.  This is useful for forcing your own version of python, running coverage tools, and running profiling tools.  i.e., these will not break with this change:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ python2 $(which spack) <args>\r\n$ coverage run $(which spack) <args>\r\n$ pyinstrument $(which spack) <args>\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese would not work if we split `spack` into a python file and a shell script (see #11783).  So, this gives us the best of both worlds.  We get to control our interpreter *and* remain a mostly pure python executable.",
