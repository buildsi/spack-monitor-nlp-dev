    "body": "So I recently updated Spack to cfde03e694b05a2aec315e0821fa82dc1e4b12c7 and installed a couple packages. Then I switched back to a slightly older branch (3ea13256205524c0a40612b712536ebea626472c) and all of a sudden Spack no longer works:\n\n```\n$ spack deactivate py-matplotlib@1.5.1~gui\n==> Error: Unable to read file: /blues/gpfs/home/software/spack-0.9.1/opt/spack/linux-centos6-x86_64/intel-16.0.3/libsigsegv-2.10-fzppdolwulhgvv63qw5vh5t4fivvb66i/.spack/spec.yaml\nCause: 'dependencies'\n```\n\nThe only difference between the spec.yaml for this libsigsegv that I installed on cfde03e694b05a2aec315e0821fa82dc1e4b12c7 and older libsigsegv spec.yaml's is that it is missing a `dependencies: {}` tag. Did we recently change the spec.yaml format to not include the dependencies tag if it is empty?\n",
