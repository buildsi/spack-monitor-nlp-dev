    "body": "@scheibelp \r\nNow that environments automatically have views attached to them (#11182)... how do I turn it off on an environment I already created?\r\n\r\nTo be more clear... I'm creating an environment by creating a directory in `environments/` and adding a `spack.yaml` file.  Then I use:\r\n```\r\nspack -e <myenv> concretize\r\nspack -e <myenv> install\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt that point, Spack decides to attach a view to my environment (which I don't want).  I never used `spack env create`, so I never got to tell Spack to NOT attach a view.  How does one change this setting *after* the environment is created? (and delete the corresponding view)?",
