    "body": "I cannot build libpciaccess. Spack uses a non-released version that doesn't have a `configure` script. It fails to create the script since the `xorg-macros` are not installed on the system:\n\n```\nautoreconf: Entering directory `.'\nautoreconf: configure.ac: not using Gettext\nautoreconf: running: aclocal -I m4\nconfigure.ac:39: error: must install xorg-macros 1.8 or later before running autoconf/autogen\nconfigure.ac:39: the top level\nautom4te: /usr/bin/m4 failed with exit status: 1\naclocal: error: echo failed with exit status: 1\nautoreconf: aclocal failed with exit status: 1\n```\n\nOne way around would be to create a `configure` script somewhere, and add it to libpciaccess as patch. Configure scripts are portable.\n",
