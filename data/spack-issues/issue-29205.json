    "body": "This patchset extends the 'spack external find' methods to a search for pkgconfig files. This will aid detecting libraries which do not provide binaries that can be checked. Since this detection method only allows to obtain information about the package availability, its version and 'prefix' path: it is not able to detect variants. Therefore, the detection method using executibles is given precedence over this one.\r\nIt adds the requirement for the 'pkgconfig' python package which relies on 'pkg-config' to be installed. The detection method will not be used if the 'pkg-config' binary cannot be found in the include path.\r\n\r\nI put this feature up for discussion, I'm open to change requests. For instance, this method can be made optional if that's preferred.",
