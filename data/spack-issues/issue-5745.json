    "body": "I'm trying to chase down a bug and it's driving me, well, buggy.  Or perhaps batty.  Anyway....\r\n\r\nI would *love* to drop\r\n\r\n```python\r\n  import pdb; pdb.set_trace()\r\n```\r\n\r\njust above where things go south and walk into it in the debugger, but all of the IO redirection and console magic seems to be getting in the way.  Is there a way to debug this?\r\n\r\nAs background, line 130-ish of `lib/spack/llnl/util/filesystem.py`\r\n\r\n```python\r\n          for line in fileinput.input(filename, inplace=True):\r\n```\r\n\r\nis throwing a Permission Denied exception on one of my clusters while installing perl (munging `Config.pm`).  Another nearly identical cluster works fine, as does a third slightly divergent cluster.\r\n\r\nI've gotten this far sticking `tty.warn()` statements into the Spack code, but from here on in I'm fiddling with `/usr/bin/python` and am not a liberty to be dropping print statements there.\r\n\r\nOtherwise my next step is to build another python (perhaps linuxbrew one) and see if a) I still have the problem and b) if I can `print()` my way into/out-of the problem there.",
