    "body": "Fixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/8546\r\n\r\n@s-sajid-ali does this help?\r\n\r\nThe `py-matplotlib` package cannot find the Spack-installed `qhull` package with `pkgconfig`. `qhull` does not generate a `.pc` file itself. This adds a method to generate a `.pc` file from a Spec and makes use of that method for `qhull`.\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n- [ ] detect the include directory for the package rather than assuming it's always `prefix/include`\r\n- [ ] likewise for `libs/`",
