    "body": "If I tell Spack to use the new concretizer but don't have `clingo` in my `PATH`/`PYTHONPATH`, Spack will bootstrap it for me. However, it doesn't seem to check whether `clingo` or its dependencies are already installed. This leads to Spack wasting time reinstalling the same hashes of dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1. Set `clingo` as the default concretizer, make sure `clingo` is not in your `PATH`\r\n2. `spack install` anything, this will cause Spack to try to bootstrap clingo\r\n3. Spack will try to install `libiconv`, `libsigsegv`, `berkeley-db`, etc. even if they are already installed\r\n3. Hit <kbd>Ctrl</kbd>+<kbd>C</kbd> during the install\r\n4. Run again and notice that Spack tries to reinstall `libiconv` and friends.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2888-a284edb852\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.10\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-catalina-ivybridge\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
