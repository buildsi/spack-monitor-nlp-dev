    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nAs much as I like the fact that `spack style` bootstraps its own dependencies, once is enough. Somehow it reinstalls the python packages multiple times a day for me when I just develop (maybe switching branches etc, but usually I rebase on the develop branch).\r\n\r\nAnd in fact it does inst all the exact same packages:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack style\r\n[+] ~/.spack/bootstrap/store/linux-ubuntu20.04-zen2/gcc-10.3.0/py-pycodestyle-2.6.0-q47yo4rnnvdt6okra7wwrgxfu7dbkhnt\r\n==> Installing py-pyflakes-2.2.0-4eexbvasziysjqzbmgf2blyo4vwzbgmw\r\n==> No binary for py-pyflakes-2.2.0-4eexbvasziysjqzbmgf2blyo4vwzbgmw found: installing from source\r\n==> Using cached archive: ~/.spack/source_cache/_source-cache/archive/4a/4a6927b9ca7fc19817176d54b3ee2ee4202f064febdee8624ee8340303cfda7b.tar.gz\r\n==> No patches needed for py-pyflakes\r\n==> py-pyflakes: Executing phase: 'build'\r\n==> py-pyflakes: Executing phase: 'install'\r\n==> Warning: Module file already exists : skipping creation\r\n```\r\n\r\nsince it shows \"Module file already exists\", and there are no duplicates in `<bootstrap prefix>/<platform>/<compiler>/*`.\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\nnone.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-3962-c9f4ad27c4\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.11\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
