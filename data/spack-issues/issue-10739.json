    "body": "Currently, `spack checksum ...` does not store the downloads in the spack cache.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThis leads to duplicate downloads of packages.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nA scenario. \r\n\r\nI was looking to add some new versions for a package, so I ran `spack checksum ...` to generate that list. That worked great, but the packages that were downloaded were NOT then added to the cache, so when I later ran `spack mirror create ...` I had to redownload everything... \r\n\r\nNot a huge deal, but it would be a nice improvement to have the checksum'd files in the cache and have the mirror creation use those downloaded, cached files.",
