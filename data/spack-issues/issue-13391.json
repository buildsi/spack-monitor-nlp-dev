    "body": "It looks like #13202 introduced a libiconv dependency for gcc. This makes C++ builds fail for me with error messages such as these (in this case, cmake bootstrapping):\r\n```\r\n../opt/spack/linux-ubuntu18.04-x86_64/gcc-7.4.0/gcc-9.2.0-7kzpeggfu32layxcv6rzunmef5ah7uwv/lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/9.2.0/../../../../lib64/libstdc++.so: undefined reference to `libiconv'\r\n```\r\nIt looks like the binaries are correctly linked against libiconv but libstdc++ is not.\r\n\r\ncc @adamjstewart",
