    "body": "This pull request adds a package for the NFFT library which provides non-equispaced discrete Fourier transform (NDFT) in one or more dimensions for complex data of arbitrary input size. This library is based on FFTW.  I have left behind several configuration flags for less \"likely\" variants ... I don't know if this is standard.",
