    "body": "Added three entries to the packages.yaml schema:\r\n\r\n`readable`: Takes a string `user`, `group`, or `world`. This describes the highest level of read permissions for the install directory.\r\n\r\n`writable`: Takes a string `user`, `group`, or `world`. This describes the highest level of write permissions for the install directory. Note that having `writable` more permissive than `readable` is an error\r\n\r\n`group`: All files in the prefix will be owned by this group.\r\n\r\nThis allows users to configure user/group/other granularity permissions to their installed packages. It does not allow configuration of executable permissions, as those are handled by the build system appropriately for each file. Executable permissions for files that the build system sets as executable are set to the level of `readable`.\r\n\r\nThe sticky group bit (gid bit) is set on all directories in the install prefix (but not on files, as it doubles as the setgid bit for files).\r\n\r\nTODO: \r\n- [x] Write unit tests",
