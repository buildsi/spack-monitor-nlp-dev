I was just working on this when you merged #6008. :-)\r\n\r\nThe `static_to_shared_library` function takes an existing static library and produces a shared library based on it.\r\n\r\nFor now, I just put it into the lua package. I would like to get some feedback whether the function's interface etc. are what you had in mind. Additionally, I would need some hints on how to integrate this better into Spack. (I have already experimented with putting it into `build_environment.py` but I currently need access to `spack_cc` and `dso_suffix`.)",
