    "body": "As part of #13920 for v0.15.0 we merged code that is probably better to move from `spack.cmd.config` to `spack.config`. There has been some discussion about possible refactoring that wouldn't modify the exposed functionality or cli at:\r\n- https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/13920#discussion_r435767986 \r\n- https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/13920#discussion_r435769471\r\n- https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/13920#discussion_r444833289 (not related to moving, but to other possible improvements to `spack.config`)\r\n\r\nThis issue is here to ensure we revisit these comments for v0.15.1",
