    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nCommit e3f97b37e64d4de70baf8e58fcd747b021d8f2f9 replaced `CPATH` by language specific environment variables in modules generated by Spack. Unfortunately this caused a regression with the Intel Fortran compilers.\r\n\r\nI think there has been a mixed-up regarding the `INCLUDE` environment variable which was added in this commit with the following comment:\r\n> The INCLUDE env variable specifies paths to look for .mod file for Intel Fortran compilers\r\n\r\nThis is true on Windows but NOT on Linux and MacOS as stated in the documentation (https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/documentation/fortran-compiler-developer-guide-and-reference/top/program-structure/using-include-files.html):\r\n> Directories are searched for include files in this order: \r\n> ...\r\n> 5. In the directories specified with environment variables CPATH (Linux* and macOS*) or INCLUDE (Windows*)\r\n\r\nI am not sure what can be done here to support ifort on Linux while avoiding the warnings mentioned by commit e3f97b37e64d4de70baf8e58fcd747b021d8f2f9.\r\n\r\n/CC @alalazo \r\n\r\nBest,\r\nR\u00e9mi",
