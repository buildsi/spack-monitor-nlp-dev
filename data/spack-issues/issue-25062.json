    "body": "Some fixes after #24074.\r\n\r\n1. When specifying multiple compute capabilities, `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` expects a list delimited by `;` not `,`.\r\n2. Current packages will set `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES=none` when no `cuda_arch` is specified. This is not a valid argument and results in CMake trying to use nvcc arch compilation flags like: `-gencode=arch=compute_,code=sm_`. Modified the packages to not set `CMAKE_CUDA_ARCHITECTURES` at all if no `cuda_arch` is specified.\r\n\r\ncc: @bvanessen ",
