    "body": "This variant (off by default) adds support for the kdreg option in the GNI provider.  It is disabled by default in order to avoid potential runtime conflicts with the cray-mpich library.  Only one library at a time can use this feature.\r\n\r\nThis patch allows the libfabric package to work correctly out of the box on systems like Cori at NERSC (since it's CLE7 update).  Otherwise the spack build may autodetect kdreg headers on the system and enable this problematic feature.",
