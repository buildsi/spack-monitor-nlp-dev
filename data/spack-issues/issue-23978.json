    "body": "Fixes #23062.\r\n\r\nSpack's source mirror was previously in a plain old S3 bucket. That will still work, but we can do better. This switches to AWS's CloudFront CDN for hosting the mirror.\r\n\r\nCloudFront is 16x faster (or more) than the old bucket.\r\n\r\n- [x] change mirror to https://mirror.spack.io",
