    "body": "Fixes  #5864.\r\n\r\n@alalazo this makes `dso_suffix` available for all packages.  I can add it to just the OpenCV package instead if being more conservative (seeing the TODO's surrounding `__all__`).  I just don't understand why it's available in other packages and not OpenCV.  The packages that use `dso_suffix` (as far as `grep` is concerned):\r\n\r\n- alglib\r\n- cp2k\r\n- elemental\r\n- flex\r\n- intel-mkl\r\n- intel-parallel-studio\r\n- libdwarf\r\n- mpich\r\n- mvapich2\r\n- opencv\r\n- openmpi\r\n- openscenegraph\r\n- py-rtree\r\n- scotch\r\n- zoltan\r\n\r\nI looked at a couple and none of them seem to need to import `dso_suffix` directly...",
