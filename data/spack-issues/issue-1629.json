    "body": "Various issues [1](http://bugs.python.org/issue1322) with the platform.linux_distribution function led\nto the function being deprecated in python 3.4. The pipi package distro\n[3](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/distro) contains compatible improved code that better tracks current methods\nfor identifying linux distributions (see, for example, [4](https://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.0.0/LSB-PDA/LSB-PDA/lsbrelease.html),[5](https://www.freedesktop.org/software/systemd/man/os-release.html)).\n\nIn particular, this PR improves detection in archlinux:\nbefore: `$ spack arch => linux--x86_64`\nafter: `$ spack arch => linux-archrolling-x86_64`\nin Scientific Linux 6\nbefore: `$ spack arch => linux-redhat6-x86_64`\nafter: `$ spack arch => linux-scientific6-x86_64`\nin Scientific Linux 7 (not sure this is actually an improvement)\nbefore: `$ spack arch => linux-redhat7-x86_64`\nafter: `$ spack arch => linux-rhel7-x86_64`\n\nThis PR overlaps with, but is othogonal to, #1329. I don't have access to relavent systems to test, but this could help ameliorate #1611 and #1560. \n",
