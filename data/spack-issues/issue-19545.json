    "body": "<!-- Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\nExample: \"I ran `spack find` to list all the installed packages and ...\" -->\r\n\r\nI am installing a bunch of packages with spack, and spack hangs after having built and installed the berkeley-db package. From the spack-build-out.txt log, it seems that berkeley-db was correctly built and installed. The last few lines of the log are `libtool: install: ...` lines and `ps aux` shows no other running commands than two `spack install` commands.\r\n\r\nWhen I kill the hanging spack, and retry installing berkeley-db, I'm getting the following warning after the install phase:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Warning: Module file already exists : skipping creation\r\nfile : /nfs2/mdorier/spack/share/spack/modules/linux-ubuntu14.04-ivybridge/berkeley-db-18.1.40-gcc-8.2.1-vp4zdna\r\nspec : berkeley-db@18.1.40%gcc@8.2.1 arch=linux-ubuntu14.04-ivybridge\r\n```\r\nand it still hangs after that.\r\n\r\nI checked out an older commit of spack from October 1st and berkeley-db builds fine with that commit, so the problem was introduced sometime between October 1st and today October 27. I also checked different versions of berkeley-db and it didn't fix the problem.\r\n\r\nThough it happens with the berkeley-db package, I am not sure whether other packages would have the same issue. The other packages I needed to build have built fine so far.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install berkeley-db\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message. If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output. If there was no error message and no output but the result is incorrect, describe how it does not match what you expect. -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --debug --stacktrace install berkeley-db\r\n```\r\noutput: [debug.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5445719/debug.txt)\r\n\r\nThe command hangs after that, there is no error message. When I kill it with Ctrl-C however, I'm getting this (along with python stack traces):\r\n```\r\nnfs2/mdorier/spack/lib/spack/spack/installer.py:1609 ==> [2020-10-27-08:50:36.416817] Error: Failed to install berkeley-db due to RuntimeError: can't re-enter readline\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-1674-bb00b1a\r\n* **Python:** 3.4.3\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu14.04-ivybridge\r\n\r\nThis also happens on ANL's Theta and Bebop supercomputers (those are the 3 platforms I have tried, and I have tried multiple file systems on them when available). I have very limited packages.yaml files with the minimum (autotools and stuff), and they differ from a platform to the other, so I don't think they are relevant.\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
