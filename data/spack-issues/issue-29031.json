It also introduces a `--all` option to restore the old behavior.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] `spack external find` looks for packages tagged as `build-tools` or `core-packages`\r\n- [x] Tag semantic for `spack external find` is changed to be OR instead of AND\r\n- [x] Added `--all` argument to restore the old behavior\r\n- [x] Tagged a few packages so they are searched by default",
