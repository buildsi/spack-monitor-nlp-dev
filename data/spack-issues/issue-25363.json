    "body": "### Summary\n\nWhen bootstrapping the new concretizer, Spack should use the system CMake if it is avaiable.\n\n### Rationale\n\n`clingo-bootstrap` only has 2 dependencies, Python and CMake. When bootstrapping the new concretizer, Spack correctly detects and uses the system Python, but doesn't use the system CMake. This leads to Spack building CMake and all of its 14 dependencies, which takes a substantial amount of time.\n\n### Description\n\nWe should detect CMake the same way we detect Python.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
