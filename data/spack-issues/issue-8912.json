Libiberty provides\r\ndemangling and support functions for the GNU toolchain.\r\n\r\nThis package uses the binutils tarfile but only builds the libiberty\r\nsubdirectory.  This is useful for other packages that want the\r\ndemangling functions without the rest of binutils.\r\n\r\nAdd variant 'fpic' to compile with -fPIC.\r\n\r\nAddresses some issues raised in PR #8806.",
