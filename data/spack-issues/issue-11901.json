This tightens up the text and mentions the Code of Conduct explicitly.\r\n\r\nThis also reduces the number of top-level files by moving `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` and `CONTRIBUTING.md` to the `.github` top-level directory.  `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` is linked in `README.md`, so people should still not miss it.  `CONTRIBUTING.md` is linked from every pull request (even if moved to `.github`).\r\n\r\n- [x] Update `README.md` to be easier to skim\r\n- [x] move `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md` to `.github`\r\n- [x] move `CONTRIBUTING.md` to `.github`",
