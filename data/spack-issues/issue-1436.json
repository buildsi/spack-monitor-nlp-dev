    "body": "I made a PR for the git package that enables perl and pcre a while back.  Since then another PR has been merged that enables gettext support.\n\nI've rebased my PR and am trying to unsuccessfully to test it, there's a gettext related problem.  I've stepped back to the commit that added gettext support and I have the same problem there.\n\nThe symptom is that it's blowing up with it tries to link executables because it can't find an implementation for libintl_gettext().  E.g. lots and lots of:\n\n```\n    LINK git-show-index\nlibgit.a(wrapper.o): In function `_':\n/tmp/throgg/spack-stage/spack-stage-d4Tihu/git-git-fdeee3d/gettext.h:54: undefined reference to `libintl_gettext'\n/tmp/throgg/spack-stage/spack-stage-d4Tihu/git-git-fdeee3d/gettext.h:54: undefined reference to `libintl_gettext'\n/tmp/throgg/spack-stage/spack-stage-d4Tihu/git-git-fdeee3d/gettext.h:54: undefined reference to `libintl_gettext'\n/tmp/throgg/spack-stage/spack-stage-d4Tihu/git-git-fdeee3d/gettext.h:54: undefined reference to `libintl_gettext'\n/tmp/throgg/spack-stage/spack-stage-d4Tihu/git-git-fdeee3d/gettext.h:54: undefined reference to `libintl_gettext'\n```\n\nIf I `spack env git bash` and cd into the staging dir and run `make -V=1` and then try to run the \"link\" command by hand I can replicate the failure.  If I try again with a `-L... -lintl` added, e.g.:\n\n```\n-L/home/throgg/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-5.4.0/gettext-0.19.8.1-dhus6ppmjmb6ze2pfml3yixa6a5o4ufn/lib -lintl\n```\n\nThen things link fine.\n\nThe `configure` script doesn't seem to have any support for `--with-gettext` so I'm not sure what should be happening.  If I comment the `depends_on('gettext')` out then the build succeeds.\n\nI'm on a fairly sparsely configure CentOS 7 system.\n\n@adamjstewart -- I think that your commit added `depends_on('gettext')` to git.  Did/does it work for you?\n",
