I.e. with high and aggressive optimization some things diverges.\r\n  *. In my test case gcc 9.3 and 10.2 failed to complete simulation if compiled with high or aggressive optimization\r\n3. A fix for compiling with gcc 10.2 fix, original error message:\r\n```\r\nError: Type mismatch in argument 'ispec' at (1); passed INTEGER(4) to INTEGER(8)\r\n```\r\n\r\n-Nikolay\r\n\r\nPS: same as https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/25397 , was having some difficulties with PR system",
