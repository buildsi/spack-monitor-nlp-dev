    "body": "This PR simply sets the F90 environment variable when compiling with Intel as suggested by [SciPy issue 9080](https://github.com/scipy/scipy/issues/9080).  Without this, the build script detects gfortran as the f90 compiler, resulting in runtime failures (e.g. missing symbols) when SciPy is subsequently used.",
