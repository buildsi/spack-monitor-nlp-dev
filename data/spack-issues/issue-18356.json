    "body": "My team has little experience with Spack and about the same with our new Shasta system.  While I know Shasta's new (our is one the first), I'm concerned that I must be missing \"something\" fundamental in how I should be configuring my compiler, etc as I can't even do a base build of zlib with cce.  \r\n```console\r\n$ spack install zlib %cce\r\n==> Installing zlib\r\n==> No binary for zlib found: installing from source\r\n==> zlib: Executing phase: 'install'\r\n==> Error: ProcessError: Command exited with status 1:\r\n    './configure' '--prefix=/apps/spack/spack-0.15.4/opt/spack/cray-sles15-zen2/cce-10.0.1/zlib-1.2.11-y3flhbrdjyke55y3dgm6f2iiepfj2rds'\r\nSee build log for details:\r\n  /tmp/hpc-adm/spack-stage/spack-stage-zlib-1.2.11-y3flhbrdjyke55y3dgm6f2iiepfj2rds/spack-build-out.txt\r\n\r\nhpc-adm@ln02-nmn:/apps/spack/spack-0.15.4/opt/spack/cray-sles15-zen2> cat /tmp/hpc-adm/spack-stage/spack-stage-zlib-1.2.11-y3flhbrdjyke55y3dgm6f2iiepfj2rds/spack-build-out.txt\r\n==> zlib: Executing phase: 'install'\r\n==> [2020-08-28-13:34:30.205627] './configure' '--prefix=/apps/spack/spack-0.15.4/opt/spack/cray-sles15-zen2/cce-10.0.1/zlib-1.2.11-y3flhbrdjyke55y3dgm6f2iiepfj2rds'\r\nCompiler error reporting is too harsh for ./configure (perhaps remove -Werror).\r\n** ./configure aborting.\r\n```\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nOn Shasta system.... \r\n- extract Spack\r\n- run setup_env.sh\r\n- spack install zlib %cce\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nThe build log shows the following error:\r\n```\r\nCompiler error reporting is too harsh for ./configure (perhaps remove -Werror).\r\n** ./configure aborting.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.10\r\n* **Platform:** cray-sles15-zen2\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
