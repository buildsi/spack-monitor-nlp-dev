    "body": "We have a heterogeneous cluster with Intel and AMD machines. spack detects the architecture (`linux-centos7-zen` and `linux-centos7-skylake_avx512`) and automatically compiles the packages with the corresponding  target. But this results in the packages not being compatible to the other architecture in the cluster. At least, the module path is not compatible. Previously, the microarchitecture was simply `linux-centos7-x86_64`.\r\n\r\nIn my oppinion, the default for target should be the smallest common denominator. So in this example `target=x86_64` instead of `zen`.\r\nIs there a possibility to disable the automatic microarchitecture specification or set a default?",
