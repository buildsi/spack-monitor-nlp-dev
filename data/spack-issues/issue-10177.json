    "body": "It looks like `pip install ...` can sometimes [fail](https://travis-ci.org/spack/spack/jobs/470905791) for the docker stage.  I'm guessing that it might have to do with `language: generic` being set instead of `language: python` , so this PR makes that change in the hopes that Travis then runs in an environment where `pip install ...` would \"just work\".",
