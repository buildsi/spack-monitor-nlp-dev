    "body": "@tgamblin @alalazo I'm planning on walking through the [Modules Tutorial](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_modules.html#modules-tutorial) at our ANL Spack Tutorial and I noticed that it requires you to build the following software:\r\n```\r\n$ spack install gcc\r\n$ spack install netlib-scalapack ^openmpi ^openblas\r\n$ spack install netlib-scalapack ^mpich ^openblas\r\n$ spack install netlib-scalapack ^openmpi ^netlib-lapack\r\n$ spack install netlib-scalapack ^mpich ^netlib-lapack\r\n$ spack install py-scipy ^openblas\r\n```\r\nDepending on whether you are building on a supercomputer or a laptop, installing GCC can take anywhere from 15 minutes (32-core Broadwell) to 4 hours (MacBook Pro). OpenMPI and MPICH usually take another half hour as well. Is there any way we can speed this up??\r\n\r\nI was thinking about using `spack install --fake`, but that won't work for GCC. You can't `spack compiler add` GCC unless the executables print the right version message. Apparently, it also doesn't work for Python packages due to my changes in #3367 (still trying to track down why). Does anyone have a better idea?",
