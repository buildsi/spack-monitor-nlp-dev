    "body": "It seems like my ```spack find``` and ```spack find --explicit``` produce exactly the same output. I'm pretty sure, that I did not install 3 versions of ```gettext``` manually... But I get\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack find --explicit |& wc -l\r\n268\r\nspack find |& wc -l\r\n268\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan anyone reproduce this? Is this a known issue?\r\n\r\nBtw. Is it intentional that the output of spack isn't written to stdout, but rather to stderr?",
