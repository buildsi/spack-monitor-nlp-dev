    "body": "### Summary\n\nMaybe this is already possible, but it seems that `-C` scopes are always read-only (`ImmutableConfigScope`), so I haven't found a way to provide a custom writeable scope.\n\n### Rationale\n\nOn CI machines that are not containerized (e.g., macOS, Windows), ensuring the CI jobs stay in a specific directory is key to keeping machines \"clean\". I'd like to tell Spack \"never write to `~/.spack`\" and have it write its configurations elsewhere. Rewriting `HOME` is a sledgehammer that may have other unintended side effects (e.g., other tools not finding their configurations which are treated as read-only).\n\n### Description\n\nSome way to add in a writeable scope at a higher precedence level than the user store. Maybe `--config-scope-write` or something?\n\n### Additional information\n\n```console\r\n$ bin/spack --version\r\n0.16.3-4938-e7c7f44bb6\r\n```\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
