    "body": "This commit (i) patches `meme` so that it compiles with `armclang` and (ii) modifies the `spack` `meme` package so that it uses the `spack` versions of `libxml2` and `libxslt`. Using the built-in versions of these packages was resulting in several linkage errors, at least when compiling with `nvhpc@21.2`.\r\n\r\nI've successfully built this package with `arm@21.0.0.879`, `gcc@10.3.0`, and `nvhpc@21.2` (provided `libxslt` is patched as per #24873).",
