    "body": "Testing show that concretizing a spec with a deep dependency tree was taking over a minute to concretize. Using cython to generate C files for the modules and linking those into .so files speed up the concretization process to ~25 seconds. For the spack-dev initial setup each co-developed package has to be concretized. This can quickly add up to over 10 minutes. Every speed improvement is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nTo use\r\ncd spack/lib/spack\r\npython setup.py build_ext --inplace\r\nto build the corresponding *.so files.\r\nRequires system or virtual env with cython installed.",
