    "body": "<!--*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*-->\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nRight now spack limited the number of parallel processes to the number of CPU's.  In fact when used with a caching compiler, much of the build time is i/o bound rather than CPU bound which makes it useful in this case to allow the number of parallel processes to exceed the number of local CPU's.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nspack should allow the user to specify parallel builds that exceed the number of CPU's, as the local machine may be using spack with a compiler server or caching compiler\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n0.15.4\r\n\r\n",
