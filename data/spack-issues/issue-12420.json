    "body": "Made the following changes:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add PyTorch 1.2.0 and `master`\r\n- [x] Add additional variants, dependencies, and conflicts\r\n- [x] Fix environment variables that changed from `NO_*` to `USE_*`\r\n- [x] Force installation to use particular BLAS library\r\n- [x] Add unit tests\r\n\r\nI was able to successfully build PyTorch 1.2.0 on macOS 10.14.6 with Clang 10.0.1 with no optional variants enabled. Build worked with OpenBLAS but not with MKL. Still needs a bit of testing, but is probably safe to merge.",
