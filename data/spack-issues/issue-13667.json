It looks like all of the deep learning AMI's on AWS come \"configured with NVIDIA CUDA, cuDNN, NCCL, Intel MKL-DNN\", so I decided those are likely the most important features.\r\n\r\n* CUDA - needed to run on a GPU\r\n* cuDNN - GPU-accelerated library of primitives for deep neural networks\r\n* NCCL - needed for distributed GPU training\r\n* MKL-DNN - optimized for Intel hardware",
