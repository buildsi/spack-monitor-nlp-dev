    "body": "Adds a development version of boost, based on their github [super repo](https://github.com/boostorg/boost).\r\nGit clones the submodules forever, but it installs! :)\r\n\r\nUseful for testing since boost tends to break complex software dependencies quite often. This helps testing it before releases.\r\n\r\n- [x] rebase after #5182 was merged",
