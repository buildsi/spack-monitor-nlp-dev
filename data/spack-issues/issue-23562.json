Attaching with `gdb` to one of these processes shows that the process is stuck in an infinite loop in `_Py_HashDouble()` around [here](https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/b05955d6f5f149523b5855a335444b7c6324bdb7/Python/pyhash.c#L116) (the `m` variable is equal to `inf` and the `while` loop never ends).\r\n\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6460615/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6460617/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart @skosukhin \r\n\r\nI was unsure if I should mention the maintainers of `intel-oneapi-compilers` too.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
