    "body": "The long description for environment modules was written out as a single line. If the description is truly long then this looks a little messy and hard to read. This PR uses the same logic for `self.long_description` as dotkit does and wraps the text to create multiple lines. This makes the output of `module show` and `module spider` (for Lmod) more readable.\n",
