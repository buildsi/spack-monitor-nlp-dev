    "body": "I have a WIP package I'm writing and `spack install` just ran successfully. However, nothing was installed! The installation prefix only contains the `.spack` directory. The package extends `MakefilePackage`, which does indeed contain:\r\n```python\r\n# Check that self.prefix is there after installation                        \r\nrun_after('install')(PackageBase.sanity_check_prefix)\r\n```\r\nso it should be run. Any ideas how to test this?",
