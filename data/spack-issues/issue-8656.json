    "body": "I'm updating the Singularity package to v2.5.2 and found this report of a fairly bad security problem:\r\n\r\n>This release contains fixes for a high severity security issue affecting Singularity 2.3.0 through 2.5.1 on kernels that support overlay file systems (CVE-2018-12021). A malicious user with network access to the host system (e.g. ssh) could exploit this vulnerability to access sensitive information on disk and bypass directory image restrictions like those preventing the root file system from being mounted into the container.\r\n>\r\n> Singularity 2.5.2 should be installed immediately, and all previous versions of Singularity should be removed. The vulnerability addressed in this release affects kernels that support overlayfs. If you are unable to upgrade immediately, you should set enable overlay = no in singularity.conf.\r\n\r\nI'm tempted to just delete the earlier versions from the package and leave a note about the change in their place (perhaps with the digest values so folks who *have* to install them can check by hand).\r\n\r\n@tgamblin (*et al.*) -- What is Spack policy for security issues?\r\n",
