    "body": "This PR removes the need to base64-encode the key(s) placed in the `SPACK_SIGNING_KEY` CI environment variable.  This has the affect that you can no longer \"mask\" the variable because it no longer meets the regular expression requirements for masked variables.\r\n\r\nThis PR also improves the pipelines documentation as it pertains to the use of the `SPACK_SIGNING_KEY` and `SPACK_GNUPGHOME` environment variables.",
