    "body": "The intel-mkl spack package has a few variants:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    ilp64 [off]       --      on, off              64 bit integers\r\n    shared [on]       --      on, off              Builds shared library\r\n    threads [none]    --      openmp, tbb, none    Multithreading support\r\n```\r\n\r\nCan we make it such that when the user requests shared libs and ilp64, the static libraries are removed as well as the lp64 ones? And how about removing the 32 bit libs on 64 bit archs too? Or through another variant?\r\n\r\nWe can also use multivalued variants in case the user needs all: `libs=static,shared integer=lp64,ilp64`.\r\n\r\nThis reduces the intel-mkl package from 3.x GB to 1.xGB, and makes it a bit faster to push it to and fetch it from a build cache.\r\n\r\nSimilar story for intel-oneapi-*.\r\n",
