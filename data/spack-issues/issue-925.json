After cloning spack from github, any time I try installing a package I get this error:\n\n$ spack install dealii\nTraceback (most recent call last):\n  File \"/home/mathlab/spack/bin/spack\", line 176, in <module>\n    main()\n  File \"/home/mathlab/spack/bin/spack\", line 154, in main\n    return_val = command(parser, args)\n  File \"/home/mathlab/spack/lib/spack/spack/cmd/install.py\", line 74, in install\n    with spack.installed_db.write_transaction():\n  File \"/home/mathlab/spack/lib/spack/spack/database.py\", line 598, in __enter__\n    if self._enter() and self._acquire_fn:\n  File \"/home/mathlab/spack/lib/spack/spack/database.py\", line 616, in _enter\n    return self._db.lock.acquire_write(self._timeout)\n  File \"/home/mathlab/spack/lib/spack/llnl/util/lock.py\", line 123, in acquire_write\n    self._lock(fcntl.LOCK_EX, timeout)   # can raise LockError.\n  File \"/home/mathlab/spack/lib/spack/llnl/util/lock.py\", line 64, in _lock\n    fcntl.lockf(self._fd, op | fcntl.LOCK_NB)\nIOError: [Errno 38] Function not implemented\n\n\n```\n",
