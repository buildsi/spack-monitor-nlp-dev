    "body": "If a package install contains a symlink to another directory in the install, view creation currently creates an empty directory in the view instead of that link.\r\n\r\nThis change causes the link_tree to instead create a relative symlink to the original target as it exists in the link_tree.\r\n\r\nFor example, an install contains the following:\r\n```\r\ninstall_path/file1\r\ninstall_path/dirA/file2\r\ninstall_path/dirB -> dirA   (dirB is a symlink to dirA)\r\n```\r\nthe following link tree is created:\r\n```\r\nview/file1 -> install_path/file1   (view/file1 is a symlink to file1 in the original install path)\r\nview/dirA  # Just a directory\r\nview/dirA/file2 -> install_path/dirA/file2\r\nview/dirB -> dirA  (A relative symlink to dirA in the view)\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
