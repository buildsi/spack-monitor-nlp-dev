    "body": "This is one of the more difficult applications I've tried to package because it's just makefiles and the makefiles are mostly based on computing sites. I'm open to any better ways to package this thing.\r\n\r\nI basically filter all the makefile options that exist to be exactly what I want, using variants where necessary, then remove all the references to `/usr` and `/opt` it searches for libraries in by default, and then I insert lines into the makefile that point the include and library locations to the Spack built libraries. Then I manually install the binary.",
