    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nInstall/configure a compiler with a module that sets `CFLAGS` or `CXXFLAGS`.\r\n\r\nInstall ncurses with\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install ncurses\r\n```\r\nDuring installation, ncurses will be configured with:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ ./configure CFLAGS='' CXXFLAGS='' ...\r\n```\r\noverriding (without appending) whatever values were set by the compiler's module file.\r\n\r\n### Platform and user environment\r\n\r\nAffects all platforms.\r\n\r\nUser environment: any environment in which the compiler is configured to have a module file that sets the `CFLAGS` or `CXXFLAGS` environment variables.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nFor my purposes, I fixed this by changing ncurses' `package.py` file:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndiff --git a/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/ncurses/package.py b/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/ncurses/package.py\r\nindex 56218a930..f6ba29239 100644\r\n--- a/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/ncurses/package.py\r\n+++ b/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/ncurses/package.py\r\n@@ -33,10 +33,12 @@ class Ncurses(AutotoolsPackage):\r\n     patch('patch_gcc_5.txt', when='@6.0%gcc@5.0:')\r\n     patch('sed_pgi.patch',   when='@:6.0')\r\n \r\n+    def setup_environment(self, spack_env, run_env):\r\n+            spack_env.append_flags('CFLAGS', self.compiler.pic_flag)\r\n+            spack_env.append_flags('CXXFLAGS', self.compiler.pic_flag)\r\n+\r\n     def configure(self, spec, prefix):\r\n         opts = [\r\n-            'CFLAGS={0}'.format(self.compiler.pic_flag),\r\n-            'CXXFLAGS={0}'.format(self.compiler.pic_flag),\r\n             '--with-shared',\r\n             '--with-cxx-shared',\r\n             '--enable-overwrite',\r\n```\r\n\r\nBeing a new user to spack, I've created an issue rather than a pull request in case this is an unwise thing to do.\r\n\r\nIn my case, the issue was preventing me from compiling with clang on a system where the standard library was specified in the `CFLAGS` and `CXXFLAGS` of my compiler's module file. Possibly my setup is non-standard, but nevertheless, it seems reasonable that whatever values are deemed necessary to specify in a compiler's configuration should never be silently overridden when installing a package, unless at the explicit request of the user.",
