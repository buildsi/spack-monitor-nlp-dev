    "body": "We should document the recommended approach for packages that change from one build system to another.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nI get asked this question almost weekly (#13466, #19298, #20364, #22209, #25111). There have been several attempts to better handle packages with multiple build systems (#10411, #12941, #15420), but we have yet to reach a consensus on any of them. We might as well document the currently recommended approach.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe should add a table similar to https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/12941#issuecomment-538105434 showing good examples of packages that have changed build systems. The current recommended approach is to inherit from the new build system and override phases using `@when` decorators as needed, then deprecating the old versions so they can be removed in a future Spack release.",
