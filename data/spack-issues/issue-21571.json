    "body": "Currently, when doing  :\r\n``` \r\ncd some_place\r\nspack dev-build -d location_of_source --drop-in zsh some_package  \r\n```\r\nspack creates a few `spack-xxx` files and a directory (`spack-build-yyy`) that are located under `location_of_source`, i.e. \"in source\". \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd some_package && ls -1dF spack-*\r\nspack-build-env.txt\r\nspack-build-out.txt\r\nspack-build-zp32c65/\r\nspack-configure-args.txt\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that in my use case `some_package` is a CMakePackage, hence capable of out-of-source builds (from the `spack-build-zp32c65/` in this example). So technically speaking the build is out-of-source, but the directory is in-source (hope my description makes sense).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nKeep the source directory clean.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI would like to have the option to get those files/directories created in `some_place` (i.e. the directory from where the spack dev-build command was launched) instead of \"polluting\" the source directory. And/or have an option in the `dev-build` command to choose the destination directory.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-951-3893ce8f71\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.2\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-bigsur-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n",
