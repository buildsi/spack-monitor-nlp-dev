Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install -j1 htop\r\n...\r\n==> htop: Executing phase: 'build'\r\n==> Error: ProcessError: Command exited with status 2:\r\n    'make' 'V=1'\r\n\r\n3 errors found in build log:\r\n     541    linux/LinuxCRT.o:(.bss+0x0): multiple definition of `backtraceArray'\r\n     542    CheckItem.o:/tmp/pnanda/spack-stage/spack-stage-htop-2.2.0-o4sejgbxgcgm3pzmej2l3ipjgplisuww/spack-src/CheckItem.c:27: first defined he\r\n            re\r\n     543    linux/LinuxCRT.o:(.bss+0x400): multiple definition of `CRT_termType'\r\n     544    CheckItem.o:(.bss+0x400): first defined here\r\n     545    linux/LinuxCRT.o:(.bss+0x408): multiple definition of `CRT_colors'\r\n     546    CheckItem.o:(.bss+0x408): first defined here\r\n  >> 547    collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\n  >> 548    make[1]: *** [htop] Error 1\r\n     549    make[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/pnanda/spack-stage/spack-stage-htop-2.2.0-o4sejgbxgcgm3pzmej2l3ipjgplisuww/spack-src'\r\n  >> 550    make: *** [all] Error 2\r\n\r\nSee build log for details:\r\n  /tmp/pnanda/spack-stage/spack-stage-htop-2.2.0-o4sejgbxgcgm3pzmej2l3ipjgplisuww/spack-build-out.txt\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nI noticed the sources are still being fetched from a deprecated address:\r\nhttps://hisham.hm/htop/releases/DEPRECATED.txt\r\n\r\n... and the latest version is 3.0.5 released this January:\r\nhttps://github.com/htop-dev/htop/releases\r\n\r\n...so it might make sense to use the newer, maintained, version instead of investigating the older version.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-3447-7d33447\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-broadwell\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6792281/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6792284/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
