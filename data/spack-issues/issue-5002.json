    "body": "I have another repo other than builtin.  There is a lulesh package in both my repo and the builtin repo.  The builtin spackage has a patch, the version in my repo does not.  Spack was looking for the patch in my repo and failing to find it.  My thought was that the way spack checks for patches ignores the namespace?  \r\nHowever after installing the patch into my repo directory to work then removing it to recreate the error solved the issue.",
