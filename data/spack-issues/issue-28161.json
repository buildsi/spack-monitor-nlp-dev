The value of `11` works fine for the other compilers on my system, just apparently not RootCling. Perhaps this is because ROOT uses an older forked version of LLVM.\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.17.0-604-c68652c88c\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-bigsur-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\n\n### Additional information\n\n@HadrienG2  @chissg @drbenmorgan @vvolkl @pcanal\r\n\r\n[spack-build-01-cmake-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7777596/spack-build-01-cmake-out.txt)\r\n[spack-build-02-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7777597/spack-build-02-build-out.txt)\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
