    "body": "There are two types of \"Unexpected indentation\" errors that I'm seeing so far in the documentation. One is in the .rst files, where someone starts a new line with a space.\n\n```\nbasic_usage.rst:1786: ERROR: Unexpected indentation.\n```\n\nThese are easy to solve. The other is indentation problems in docstrings.\n\n```\npackage_list.rst:321: WARNING: Block quote ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.\n```\n\n```\n/blues/gpfs/home/software/spack-0.9.1/lib/spack/spack/config.py:docstring of spack.config:11: WARNING: Enumerated list ends without a blank line; unexpected unindent.\n```\n\nThese will be a bit more tricky, particularly for core Spack library classes. I'll attempt to solve both of these problems.\n\nThis bug was discovered in #1576 by adding documentation testing. It will be fixed in #1576. This issue is being opened to track the problem.\n",
