    "body": "This is the continuation from outdated PR https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/24445 with latest hypre release 2.22.1 (this release improves GPU support) and of course merge with commits performed in the meantime. This had been reviewed by @osborn9 and @alalazo.\r\nThere remains the debate, as pointed out by @adamjstewart, over Package, AutotoolsPackage versus CMakePackage as proposed by @junghans with PR https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/24817.\r\nI personally like the autotoolspackage since I'm better used to it ! This is also the way I compile Hypre when outside of spack. As well, the simplest way to install hypre for Unix like systems is configure, as I understand from\r\nhttps://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/blob/master/INSTALL.md\r\n",
