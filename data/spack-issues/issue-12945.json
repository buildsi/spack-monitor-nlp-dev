    "body": "I went to clean up my aging installs, and deleted all the files.  I did not\r\nupdate `~/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml`, so it still pointed to  several compilers that\r\nno longer existed.\r\n\r\nI went to do various installs, and they all failed with errors that did not indicate\r\nthe problem was with the compiler.  I think spack should report an error like:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    gcc@7.3.0 specified in ~/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml does not exist\r\n```",
