Put a flowchart at the top of file X!\r\n\r\nAt the very top of file X, describe either a literal or figurative flowchart for contributors. The intent of the flowchart would be very similar to our current issue templates, focusing  on triage and documentability.\r\n\r\nThis is one flowchart I made just now representing the current state of file X:\r\n     - Unclear Fix => ???\r\n     - Clear Fix => Make a fix to spack using all of the instructions on this page.\r\n     - Large Change => ???\r\n\r\n#### Contribution Guide Mismatches\r\n\r\nThere are a couple things I noticed in the contribution guide that made me want to prioritize the \"flowchart\":\r\n(a) In particular, I wanted to point out that it made me laugh when I found the only existing docs on \"writing a big PR\" in all of Spack are at the end of a long section on git cherry-pick:\r\n> Note:\r\n> It is important that whenever you change something that might be of importance upstream, create a pull request as soon as possible. Do not wait for weeks/months to do this, because:\r\n>     - you might forget why you modified certain files\r\n>     - it could get difficult to isolate this change into a stand-alone clean PR.\r\n\r\nIt seems more efficient to be able to address that situation before our users are  rebasing constantly!\r\n\r\n(b) And more directly, we have *all* of the content we would need for the \"Clear Fix\" section of the flowchart -- this is already at the top of the Contribution Guide\r\n> Important is completed feature. The changes one proposes in a PR should correspond to one feature/bugfix/extension/etc. One can create PRs with changes relevant to different ideas, however reviewing such PRs becomes tedious and error prone. If possible, try to follow the one-PR-one-package/feature rule.\r\n\r\n- (a) might be rewritten as **a failure mode to avoid from the start** for the \"Large Change\" section of the flowchart.\r\n- (b) could **replace the \"Clear Fix\" section of the flowchart entirely.**\r\n\r\n### 3. Propose workflow for the \"Unclear Fix\"\r\n\r\n*I propose a workflow specifically for the \"Unclear Fix\" section of the flowchart from  (2).*\r\n\r\nIt is not always clear whether it's preferred to ping the slack Y times vs create an issues. In line with the explicit flowchart described in  (2), I would like the section for our customer segment \"Unclear Fix\" to be something like:\r\n1. *Search* for a similar issue.\r\n2. *Check* Slack, then\r\n3. *Match* labels.\r\n\r\n, while modifying the priority of those tasks as seems fit.\r\n\r\nAnd let's call it just **\"(c)\"** to match the rest.",
