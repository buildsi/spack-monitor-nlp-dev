    "body": "In order to use the signed buildcache I need to import the public key of the server somehow. I can't simply do `spack gpg trust file://mnt/spack-mirror` because for some unexplained in the documentation reason `spack buildcache create` does not put the public key there, even though it uses the corresponding private key to sign the packages it writes.\r\n\r\n`spack gpg export` would work, if it exported the public key, not the private.\r\n\r\n\r\nedit:\r\nI have to add that `gpg` itself with its default keyring is unaware of any of the spack keys, so using for that purpose is far from obvious. `gpg --list-secret-keys` returns nothing.\r\n\r\n\r\n   *   *   *\r\n  \r\nI use spack `0.13.3-935-0c0aba57` on Ubuntu 18.04.4 64 bit",
