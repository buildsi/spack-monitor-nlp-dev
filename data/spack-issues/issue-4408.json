    "body": "The fun started when configure discovered a broken/partial installation of `swig` in `/usr/local`, then auto-discovered my system's python and ruby packages.\r\n\r\n- SpackException doesn't seem to exist.  Convert it to ~a SpackError~ an InstallError  and call `.format(...)` on the error string to fill in the placeholder.\r\n\r\n- Pull swig out of the list of languages.  It's something that can be asked for explicitly and that is needed if *any* of the langagues are enabled.  It's disabled by default.\r\n\r\n- Explicitly disable the languages that are in \"untested_bindings\" list lest the configure script pick up things from the system.",
