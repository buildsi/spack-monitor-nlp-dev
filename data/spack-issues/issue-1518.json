    "body": "Fixes #1203. Apple ships headers in Yosemite (and possibly earlier) that\nare gcc-incompatible, but compile fine with clang. The fix is to copy\nthe offending system header from /usr/include/${REST_OF_HEADER_PATH} to\n${GCC_PREFIX}/include/${REST_OF_HEADER_PATH} and replace the non-gcc-\ncompatible features with gcc-compatible equivalents.\n\nSee https://github.com/hashdist/hashstack/pull/771/files for\ninspiration, and\nhttp://hamelot.io/programming/osx-gcc-dispatch_block_t-has-not-been-declared-invalid-typedef/\nfor a description of the header issue.\n",
