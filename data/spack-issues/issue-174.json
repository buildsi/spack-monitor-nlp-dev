    "body": "I'm trying to debug a build problem. I'm looking at the log file, which begins by listing the `configure` command. It's difficult to see exactly what options were given because these options contain spaces. Adding quotes to this log output would be better.\n\nFor example, instead of outputting\n\n```\n./configure --with-flags=a b c\n```\n\nI'd like to see\n\n```\n./configure --with-flags='a b c'\n```\n",
