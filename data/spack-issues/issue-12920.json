    "body": "After updating to HEAD today, my whole system broke. This may not only have to do with spack but also with the centOS upgrades.\r\n\r\nAnyway, now every `spack module <> refresh -y` call has no effect. I see no errors but also no env modules are created anymore. Meanwhile I removed all to start \"fresh\" and now I am here without any.\r\n\r\nI already resetted everything and initialized spack from scratch, no success.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have any idea what might be the problem? I can install formulas but not generate env modules anymore.\r\n\r\n(Calling `module` brings up the system installed lmod overview screen. )",
