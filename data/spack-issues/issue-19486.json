    "body": "Merge this after #18225.\r\n\r\nSince #18225, shell integration no longer requires setting `SPACK_ROOT`, so we can simplify the documentation on it. The docs on shell support and using packages are getting a bit old, and information on `spack load` (which seems to be everyone's most common way of using packages) is hard to find.\r\n\r\nThis PR simplifies the shell documentation to remove SPACK_ROOT, and also moves some sections around for clearer organization.\r\n\r\n- [x] make docs on sourcing setup scripts clearer and simpler\r\n- [x] introduce `spack load` early in the basic usage guide instead of\r\n      burying it in the module docs\r\n- [x] clean up module docs so that spack module tcl loads comes later\r\n- [x] be clear about the different ways to use packages so that the users\r\n      can find the docs better.",
