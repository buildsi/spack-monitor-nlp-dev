    "body": "`spack install` command  calls spack.package.try_install_from_binary_cache() which calls spack.binary_distribution.get_specs(). \r\n\r\nspack.binary_distribution.get_specs() was modified in \r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/pull/13002\r\nto allow listing and installing buildcaches for macOS on a linux host.\r\n\r\nIn the case where a mirror contains buildcaches for multiple OSes the spack install command can spend more time downloading all of the specs from the build_cache directory than it takes to install the buildcache. The is especially true when using pipelines and the buildcache download directory is cleared between steps.\r\n\r\nI will modify the get_specs() command to accept a filter option and pass the current OS as the filter option when get_specs() is called from spack.package.try_install_from_binary_cache()\r\n",
