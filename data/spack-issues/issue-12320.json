    "body": "@mpbelhorn and @Paul-Ferrell reported a bug with Spack stacks for nested matrices.\r\n\r\nThe resulting error reads `dict object has no attribute 'startswith'`.\r\n\r\nThis PR resolves the error. There was no associated issue on github.\r\n\r\nAlso fixes a minor error in matrix concretization for variants with multi-word names (with dashes in the names) because that came up in the reproducer given to me by @Paul-Ferrell",
