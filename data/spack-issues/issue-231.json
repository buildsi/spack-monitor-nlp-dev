    "body": "This PR adds dependencies to `flex` and `bison` and compression from the package already on spack.\nThe flex and bison dependencies are only for compilation and the makefiles have a fallback to pre-generated files so these dependencies could perhaps been removed.\nThe `zlib` dependency is configurable with a variant `compression`\n\nIt also permits to build shared libraries\nWhat should be the default static or shared ? For now I put the default as shared since it works better with the rpath strategy in spack.\n\nThe dependency to mpi add the library `pt-scotch` so I made it a variant. In addition to `esmumps` that was not there.\n\nI did not change the install strategy used in the package. But it also installs also a metis.h file that goes with `libscotchmetis` and could interfere with the package metis, if both module are loaded at the same time.\n",
