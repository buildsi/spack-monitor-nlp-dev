    "body": "Depends on #7116 and #7119.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the release testing described in #7116, Spack should do build tests on pull requests made to `develop`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Create a binary package repository with builds for the latest `develop`.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement PR testing for develop in a similar way to releases -- treat `develop` as an \"ongoing\" release, and it should have a default set of test builds defined in a `release.yaml` (or maybe some other name) a the root of the repository.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Develop a suitable purge policy for `develop`.  We can't keep around all builds as binary packages, but we can keep around some. \r\n\r\n- [ ] Implement the ability for authorized users to comment on PRs and trigger builds of specified dependents of the packages in the PR.  A user with Spack write access should be able to comment on a PR with syntax like `build: <spec>` and trigger the build of the specified spec.",
