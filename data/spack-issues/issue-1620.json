It shows up pretty clearly in the documentation:\nhttp://software.llnl.gov/spack/packaging_guide.html#concretization-policies\n\nThe solution is to add the missing tag to the Concretization Preferences section of Configuration.\n\nThis bug was discovered in #1576 by adding documentation testing. It will be fixed in #1576. This issue is being opened to track the problem.\n",
