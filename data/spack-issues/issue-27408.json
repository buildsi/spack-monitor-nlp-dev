    "body": "The side-effect of https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/27379 was that `tty.set_verbose(args.verbose or args.install_verbose)`.\n\nThere is one cdash test that actually tests tty.verbose(...) output from an install('-v', ...) command, so instead of setting just `tty.set_verbose(args.verbose)` I think it's easiest to keep verbose tty output, except that some messages about locks and such should be debug messages.\n",
