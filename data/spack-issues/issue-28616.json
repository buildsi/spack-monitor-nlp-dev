    "body": "Xyce contains the CMake logic:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset(CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD 11) \r\n```\r\n\r\nso all other `CMAKE_CXX_STANDARD` values will be ignored. This PR adds the variant `cxxstd` to the Xyce recipe with a default value of 11 and a valid option of only 11. Also, the `cxxstd=` is propagated to Trilinos, because only Trilinos 12.12.1 is used as a dependency, and this version of Trilinos was designed and tested for `-std=c++11`.",
