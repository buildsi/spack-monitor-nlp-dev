    "body": "This new patch is required to build hypre with openmp.\r\nThe root cause is explained here: https://github.com/hypre-space/hypre/pull/225\r\nhypre's build system doesn't add the -fopenmp flag unless the compiler name matches some preset ones, and absolute paths break that logic.\r\n\r\nThere have been a few changes to the configure script, so the line numbers might be off.  It might be better to rephrase this patch with a sed command.  I don't know how to do that.",
