I don't think spack should be issuing this warning.  \n\nFor completeness, my `packages.yaml` has the following:\n\n```\npackages:\n  mkl:\n    version: [11.3.3.210]\n    paths:\n      mkl@11.3.3.210%intel@16.0.3 arch=linux-redhat6-x86_64: /usr/projects/hpcsoft/toss2/common/intel-clusterstudio/2016.3.067/compilers_and_libraries_2016.3.210/linux/mkl\n    buildable: False\n  all:\n    compiler: [intel@16.0.3]\n    providers:\n      blas: [mkl]\n      lapack: [mkl]\n```\n\nI would like to know if there is something wrong with my configuration that is causing this warning.\n",
