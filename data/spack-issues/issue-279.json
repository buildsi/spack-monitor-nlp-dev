However, it's difficult to debug since I don't know which symbolic couldn't be created. I didn't ask for a symbolic link, I think it must be Spack doing this internally, probably having to do with unpacking an archive. This is the relevant description in my recipe:\n\n```\n    resource(name='objconv',\n             url='http://www.agner.org/optimize/objconv.zip',\n             md5='fcf8f01a5683387e17df6d21497d53fa',\n             destination='objconv',\n             when='+ilp64')\n```\n\nCould you output the file names `source_path` and `link_path` with the error message?\n",
