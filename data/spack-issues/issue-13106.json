    "body": "This change mirrors the `install` command's ability to take spec-input via specfiles.\r\n\r\nSame as for `install` they can be supplied via `--file`.\r\n\r\nThis is useful when concretizing a bunch of packages in parallel and then fetching them in sequence so every dependency is only downloaded once.",
