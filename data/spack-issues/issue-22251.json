    "body": "This pull request will add the ability for a user to add a configuration argument on the fly, on the command line, e.g.,:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ spack -c config:install_tree:root:/path/to/config.yaml -c packages:all:compiler:[gcc] list --help\r\n```\r\nThe above command doesn't do anything (I'm just getting help for list) but you can imagine having another root of packages, and updating it on the fly for a command (something I'd like to do in the near future!)\r\n\r\nI've moved the logic for config_add that used to be in spack/cmd/config.py into spack/config.py proper, and now both the main.py (where spack commands live) and spack/cmd/config.py use these functions. I only needed spack config add, so I didn't move the others. We can move the others if there are also needed in multiple places. Thanks to @becker33 for helping out with my questions on slack this morning!\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
