The Apple libsystem_c\r\n        library cannot be linked to directly using an absolute path; doing so\r\n        will cause the linker to throw an error 'cannot link directly with\r\n        /usr/lib/system/libsystem_c.dylib' and the linker will suggest linking\r\n        with System.framework instead. Linking to this framework is equivalent\r\n        to linking with libSystem.dylib, which can be confirmed on a macOS\r\n        system by executing at a terminal the command `ls -l\r\n        /System/Library/Frameworks/System.Framework` -- the file \"System\" is a\r\n        symlink to `/usr/lib/libSystem.B.dylib`, and `/usr/lib/libSystem.dylib`\r\n        also symlinks to this file.

Can you remove conflicts ('platform=linux') so that the software can be installed on linux, or do you have any other way to provide it to me?\r\n### Information on your system\r\nlocalhost:~ # spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-1673-31cf0e9c0d\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-sles15-aarch64\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
