    "body": "Hi,\n\nI find that  share/spack/setup-env.sh fails when executed indirectly from a symlink, say, from /etc/profile.d/spack-setup.sh\n\nThis is easily fixed by changing line 155 of setup-env.sh to use the  `readlink` function:\n\n```\n_sp_source_file=$(readlink -f \"${BASH_SOURCE[0]}\")  # Bash's location of last sourced file.\n```\n\nAgreed?\n\nI tested in zsh too.\n\nI promise I will get with the pull-requests soon.\n\n~Malcolm\n",
