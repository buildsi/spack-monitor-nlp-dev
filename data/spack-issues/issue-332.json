    "body": "I am using `gpc`, and HPC system in Toronto. Spack doesn't correctly detect the system compilers, so I `module add gcc` and then `spack compiler add gcc` to get a working compiler.\n\nUnfortunately, this compiler requires `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`:\n\n```\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/scinet/gpc/compilers/gcc-4.6.1/requiredlibs/lib:/scinet/gpc/compilers/gcc-4.6.1/lib:/scinet/gpc/compilers/gcc-4.6.1/lib64:/scinet/gpc/toolbin/x11/lib\n```\n\nWhen Spack tries to build OpenMPI, it resets `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`, leading then to linker failures since certain C++ libraries are not found.\n",
