    "body": "This PR adds the command `spack bootstrap dependencies` which prints the dependency of clingo-bootstrap such that the list can be passed to `spack mirror create` with the help of, e.g., `xargs`.\r\n\r\nThis command simplifies bootstrapping Spack on computers with restricted internet access with the following steps:\r\n\r\n1. Untrust `github-actions` on the machine with restricted internet acces to avoid unnecessary waiting.\r\n2. Have `spack bootstrap dependencies` print a machine-readable list of dependencies on the machine with restricted internet acces.\r\n3. Copy-and-paste the output into `spack mirror create` on a machine with internet access.\r\n4. Upload the Spack cache with scp to the machine with restricted internet access.\r\n5. Run `spack spec zlib` on the machine with restricted internet access.\r\n\r\ncloses #28540\r\n",
