    "body": "This is yet another follow-up to #24095.\r\n\r\nOn most systems that I've tested, the platform-dependent and platform-independent site packages directories are the same. However, in #25973, @robertu94 discovered that on his system, this is not the case. During installation, we pass both `--install-purelib` and `--install-platlib`, and Cython chooses to install to `platlib` instead of `purelib`. I see two possibilities:\r\n\r\n1. Packages always install to `platlib` and we should always add `platlib` to the `PYTHONPATH` (done in this PR)\r\n2. The installation directory changes from `platlib` to `purelib` depending on the package and we need to add both to the `PYTHONPATH`\r\n\r\n@robertu94 can you test this and see if it introduces more bugs than it fixes? I'm also hoping GitLab will catch any potential issues as it builds a decently sized Python stack.",
