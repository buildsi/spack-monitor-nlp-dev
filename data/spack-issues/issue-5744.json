This patches Paraview to avoid using `git describe` to find its own version number and to use its own shipped version number instead.\r\n\r\nI have not fixed the Paraview module file to point the library paths to `lib/paraview-5.4` where Paraview actually installs the libraries rather than just `lib`.
