    "body": "Fixes #2836.  Fixes #2419.\r\n\r\nI finally updated the MPI section in the Spack documentation by distilling this [google group post](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/spack/ECmt5-Ew3yo/Is0F2lLHCAAJ).\r\n\r\nThis includes many more details on how the compiler wrappers work and how they interact with MPI.\r\n\r\nI think the packaging guide needs some reworking -- the top-level TOC is too long right now, and the topics aren't organized as clearly as they could be.  But I'll save a more extensive rework for later, as @alalazo has the pending documentation PR #2780.\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart @citibeth @alalazo \r\n\r\n",
