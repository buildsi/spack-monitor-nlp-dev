    "body": "Fixes #1754. Fixes #1457.\r\n\r\n- [x] Fixes issues with hashing where deptypes from one dependency would be\r\n  overwritten by those of another dependency on the same package.\r\n\r\n  - Copying specs (`Spec.copy()`, `Spec._dup()`) did not handle deptypes\r\n     correctly:\r\n\r\n  - Copying \"flattened\" dependencies, but in doing so it collapsed\r\n    multiple dependency relationships into one, losing some edge\r\n    information in the DAG.\r\n\r\n- [x] This gets rid of the `flat_dependencies_with_deptypes()` method,\r\n    which doesn't really make sense, as it collapses edges. It's now\r\n    reverted the original `flat_dependnecies()`.\r\n\r\n- [x] `traverse_with_deptypes()` is now called `traverse_edges()`, which is\r\n    when edge information must be preserved.\r\n\r\n- [x] This gets rid of the notion of \"default deptypes\" introduced in #2307.\r\n\r\n  - Initially created Specs now have empty deptypes instead of \"defaults\".\r\n\r\n  - Proper deptypes are added during normalization/concretization like\r\n    everything else in the Spec class.  Empty deptypes mean deptypes are\r\n    not yet specified, and the spec is abstract.\r\n\r\n- [x] Updated tests.",
