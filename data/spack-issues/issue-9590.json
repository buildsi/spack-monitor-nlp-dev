    "body": "Report to CDash how long it took to install package(s)\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nCurrently the CDash reporter sends up a build time of 0s to CDash.  But Spack knows how long it actually took to install a package:\r\n```\r\n==> Successfully installed python\r\n  Fetch: 0.07s.  Build: 2m 33.14s.  Total: 2m 33.21s.\r\n```\r\nSo we should be able to pass this info up to CDash.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTrack the build time for each package installed by `spack install`.  Tally these values up and report the total to CDash.",
