    "body": "Fixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/29192 (ESMF doesn't built on macOS with apple-clang+gfortran, doesn't built with gfortran-10+, and doesn't build on Cray). These are the three changes related to the three errors in the issue:\r\n\r\n1. Add the missing logic for `apple-clang`\r\n2. Add the usual `-fallow-argument-mismatch`\r\n3. For Cray, one needs to export `ESMF_OS=Unicos`\r\n\r\nThis has been tested on macOS with (llvm-)clang@13.0.0 + gfortran@11.2.0 and with apple-clang@13.0.0 + gfortran@11.2.0, as well as on ORNL's Gaea system.",
