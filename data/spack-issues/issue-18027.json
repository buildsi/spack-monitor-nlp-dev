    "body": "When Spack fails to download a tarball, print the expected checksum of that failed download in the error message.  Something like (see last line below):\r\n\r\n```\r\n[+] /data/home/eafischer2/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu18.04-core2/gcc-7.4.0/py-cftime-1.0.3.4-bg7l3z5d7lk35icifwypkrwqsvu3uv2b\r\n==> 15494: Installing cdo\r\n==> Fetching https://code.mpimet.mpg.de/attachments/download/21529/cdo-1.9.9rc2.tar.gz\r\n...\r\n==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for spack-stage-cdo-1.9.9.rc2-tdm3inpmja3pnwm4heinm75xbznpknkc\r\nvar/spack/cache/_source-cache/archive/23/2328299c43ecd10f8283056b6a65e6f205fb64e988ce360fc2b30672e7491e66*\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThis will allow us to easily `rsync` the tarball from another Spack installation, without digging through Spack recipes.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAlternative is to name Spack download cache tarballs with decipherable names, like they used to.  That would be nice too.  But I suppose the change was made for ar eason.\r\n",
