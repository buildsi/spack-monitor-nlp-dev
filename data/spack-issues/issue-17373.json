    "body": "Fixes #17354 \r\n\r\n@glennpj @alalazo @iarspider can you see if this PR contains the desired behavior? Here's what I think is best:\r\n\r\n1. If `--batch` is supplied to `spack create` or `spack checksum`, download everything\r\n2. If only a single version is found, don't bother asking how many versions to download, just download it\r\n3. If one or more versions are passed to `spack checksum`, download all of them\r\n4. Otherwise, ask how many to download/checksum\r\n\r\nWould love to add unit tests for `spack checksum`, but unit tests that require an internet connection are unreliable. Thoughts on how to make this work?",
