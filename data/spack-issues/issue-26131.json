    "body": "When using the ONNX package inside of an environment that specifies a\r\npython3 executable, it will attempt to use a system installed\r\nversion.  This can lead to a failure where the system python and the\r\nenvironment python don't agree and the system python ends up with an\r\ninvalid environment.  Forces ONNX to use the same version of python as\r\nthe rest of the spec.\r\n\r\nAdds hashes for the latest version of ONNX.",
