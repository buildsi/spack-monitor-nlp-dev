    "body": "I know we've gone back and forth with this before (see #14058, #14234, #16350, etc) but I wanted to reopen this discussion.\r\n\r\nI propose we relax the Java dependency and let users build with whatever version of Java they want. Oracle JDK 8 can no longer be downloaded automatically, so that makes it problematic in many ways. I have OpenJDK 11.0.7 on my Ubuntu 20.04 instance and it builds Bazel just fine.\r\n\r\nPinging some interested parties: @lee218llnl @healther @coreyjadams @Sinan81 @s-sajid-ali @darmac \r\n\r\nCloses #14058",
