    "body": "Package added by @adamjstewart, it's not clear to me what the utility of having the `googletest` and `googlebenchmark` libraries is for this header only library.  Those are developer targets, not needed for installation.  They add ~45 things to compile, whereas without them essentially cmake is just being used as an install wrapper.\r\n\r\nThere were compilation failures with `gcc@11` so locally I just deleted them rather than trying to figure out how to patch a `resource` that is missing some `#include` statements resulting in compilation failure.",
