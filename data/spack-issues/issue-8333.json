I am working behind a corporate proxy; I have configured curl with my ```.curlrc``` file to specify the proxy URL and port, and have set ```CURL_CA_BUNDLE``` to point to our cert file. This setup worked for the other 20 or so packages I attempted to mirror.\r\n\r\nFor whatever reason when trying to fetch from ```http://ftp.gnome.org/pub/gnome/sources/gtk+/2.24/gtk+-2.24.32.tar.xz```, a ```403 AuthorizedOnly``` is kicked back. From https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/lib/spack/spack/fetch_strategy.py#L239, we can see that ```-f``` is supplied to curl to fail on such an error. Oddly enough, removing this flag allowed me to featch the file without any issues.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\ncurl v7.43.0",
