Other types of sources (e.g. fetched from a git repository) do not have a well-known checksum and for example would not be suitable for a public mirror.\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n- [x] ~reduce fragility of test (currently assigns URL to package version at a point when previous test actions could have already created a fetcher from it)~ this wasn't actually a problem",
