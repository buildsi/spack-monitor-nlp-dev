    "body": "fixes #3181 (either that or this issue was already fixed by #15158)\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] The schema for `packages.yaml` has been updated. Old configuration files are not allowed anymore and Spack will error out in their presence. The new schema permits to store arbitrary  attributes for each external detected.\r\n- [x] The detection mechanism has been extended to account for these custom attributes. A validation step is now in place to ensure the detected specs are in a proper state before writing them to `packages.yaml`. All specs that are detected must be created with `Spec.from_detection`.\r\n- [x] The GCC package can now be detected automatically\r\n- [x] A command to update existing configuration files to the new format has been added\r\n- [x] A command to revert configuration updates has been added too\r\n- [x] All the occurences of `packages.yaml` displayed in the docs have been updated\r\n- [x] Added a decorator to mark detectable packages and a command to list them\r\n- [x] Documentation for external spec detection has been extended",
