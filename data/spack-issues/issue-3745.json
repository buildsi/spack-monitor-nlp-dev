    "body": "Adds a package for mallocMC, a memory allocator for many core architectures.\r\n\r\nThis project provides a framework for fast memory managers on many core accelerators. Currently, it supports NVIDIA GPUs of compute capability sm_20 or higher through the ScatterAlloc algorithm. mallocMC is header-only.\r\n\r\n## Downstream Dependencies\r\n\r\n[PIConGPU](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics/picongpu) and [other projects](https://github.com/ComputationalRadiationPhysics) of [HZDR](https://www.hzdr.de/crp)'s *Computational Radiation Physics* group\r\n\r\n## References\r\n\r\n- Markus Steinberger, Michael Kenzel, Bernhard Kainz and Dieter Schmalstieg.\r\n  *ScatterAlloc: Massively parallel dynamic memory allocation for the GPU*,\r\n  Innovative Parallel Computing (InPar), 2012,\r\n  https://doi.org/10.1109/InPar.2012.6339604\r\n\r\n- Carlchristian Eckert.\r\n  *Enhancements of the massively parallel memory allocator ScatterAlloc and its adaption to the general interface mallocMC*,\r\n  Junior Thesis (grosser Beleg), 2014,\r\n  http://dx.doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.34461",
