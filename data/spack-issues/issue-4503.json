    "body": "cmake comes with ctest, which is used to run all tests created by cmake.   Using ctest provides more options than simply calling \"make test\".   I request that ctest be used in the test phase for packages built with cmake.  Note that both commands return status 0 if there are no tests to execute.  \r\n\r\n The main reason for this request is that ctest recognizes and uses the -jN option.  Unfortuntately, in the context of cmake, \"make test -jN\" simply runs the tests serially.",
