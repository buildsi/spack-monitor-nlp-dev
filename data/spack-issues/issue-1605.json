    "body": "In the Basic Usage and Packaging Guide documentation, several section title underlines were too short. This caused warning messages like:\n\n```\nbasic_usage.rst:1500: WARNING: Title underline too short.\n\nLimitations of Filesystem Views\n~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~          <\n```\n\nAside from the warning message, I don't see any other problems this caused.\n\nThis bug was discovered in #1576 by adding documentation testing. It will be fixed in #1576. This issue is being opened to track the problem.\n",
