If not, I will go back to a clean slate and rebuild the bootstrap phase.\r\n\r\nIt looks like the bootstrap clingo installation assumes that the static version of libstdc++ exists by adding the option `-static-libstdc++`. See here: https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/314f5fdb974260c31e84245513756f5ca67b06f6/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/clingo-bootstrap/package.py#L63\r\n\r\nMy system doesn't have static libstdc++ installed, so static linking was causing an issue. The build error on my system was resolved by removing the `-static-libstdc++` and `-static-libgcc` flags.\r\n\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
