    "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nthe \"architecture\" directory keeps potentially superfluous information in homogeneous clusters.\r\nCustomisation via projections seems to affect only the path for the applications, not their modules.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nDefault convention:\r\n````console\r\n/opt/ohpc/pub/modules/linux-centos8-x86_64/gcc/9.3.0\r\n````\r\nDesired option:\r\n````console\r\n/opt/ohpc/pub/modules/zen2/gcc/9.3.0\r\n````\r\nOr even better:\r\n````console\r\n/modules/zen2/gcc/9.3.0\r\n````\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSpack 0.16.2 always includes the architecture directory in the module path, and it would be great if one could customise that, e.g. by limiting it to \"target\".\r\nThis would help to abbreviate the path in the user's view for \"module av\" in all situations, where the entire cluster is on Linux and is on the same OS level.\r\nIs there any option for that i missed so far?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n````console\r\nspack --version\r\n0.16.2-3869-81be31aee0\r\n````\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
