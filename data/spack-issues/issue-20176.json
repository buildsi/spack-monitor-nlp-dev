    "body": "In my case mpich 3.3.2 does not build, because a patch triggers autoconf to be called again, and autoconf is not a direct build dependency of mpich. This PR adds an unconditional dependency on the autotools build packages, since findutils is a dependency of mpich already, and it depends on those packages anyways.\n",
