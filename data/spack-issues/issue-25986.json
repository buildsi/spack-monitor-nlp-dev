    "body": "The `spack.architecture` module contains an `Arch` class that is very similar to `spack.spec.ArchSpec` but points to platform, operating system and target objects rather than \"names\". There's a TODO in the class since 2016:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/blob/abb0f6e27c45758c37fd45d663214b86413fb4f6/lib/spack/spack/architecture.py#L70-L75\r\n\r\nand this PR basically addresses that. Since there are just a few places where the `Arch` class was used, here we query the relevant platform objects where they are needed directly from `spack.platforms`. This permits to clean the code from vestigial logic.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] Remove the `spack.architecture` module and replace its use by `spack.platforms`\r\n- [x] Remove unneeded tests",
