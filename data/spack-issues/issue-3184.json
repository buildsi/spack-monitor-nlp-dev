    "body": "`compgen` does not work the way I expected. `compgen -o filenames` doesn't list any results. If I use `compgen -o filenames -A file` or `compgen -o default`, it will list results, but directories will not have a `/` appended. The only way to get this working is to use `complete -o default`. This has the unfortunate side-effect of adding directories/filenames as possible values any time there are no other possible results, but I don't see a better way around this.\r\n\r\nP.S. I just noticed that `spack install []` will list all packages, but `spack install gcc []` will list no results (will now list filenames/directories). I wonder if I can fix this (in another PR).",
