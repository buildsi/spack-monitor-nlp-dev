    "body": "Fixes: https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/9083\r\n\r\nThe linked issue contains examples where Spack's parsing of `module show` produces incorrect results. This makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Updates the pattern searching for several paths to avoid the case where they are prefixes of unwanted paths\r\n* Adds a warning message when an extracted path doesn't exist (which may help catch future module parsing bugs faster)\r\n* Adds a test with the content mentioned in #9083 ",
