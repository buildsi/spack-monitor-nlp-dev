    "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nPer https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/24639#discussion_r707835983, `GitFetchStrategy` should use something faster than Python's `shutil.move` / `shutil.copy` commands to copy cloned git repositories into place.  Possible approaches:\r\n\r\n* `rsync`\r\n* `git clone` again to copy the cloned repository\r\n* clone directly to the destination in the first place\r\n* others?\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nPython's copying logic is slow and can take a long time when setting up a dev environment.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
