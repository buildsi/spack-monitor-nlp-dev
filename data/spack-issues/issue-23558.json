    "body": "Due to limitations in Make or CMake's Makefile generation, using Make as the generator significantly limits the parallelism available for building HPX. CMake+Ninja does a much better job of exposing parallelism, and as such I think it's worth changing the default generator.\r\n\r\nI couldn't tell from other packages if this needs an additional `depends_on('ninja', type='build')` as well. It works without it so I assume it's fine like this, but please let me know if it's preferable for some reason to have it there.",
