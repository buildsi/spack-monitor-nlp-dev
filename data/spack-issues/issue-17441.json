Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\nIn my cluster, intel parallel studio has been manually installed before. When I tried to install intel package using spack, it failed because of detected exsiting intel installation.\r\n\r\nI checked [Uninstall Intel\u00ae Compiler for Linux* When uninstall.sh is Missing or...](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/articles/uninstall-intel-compiler-for-linux-when-uninstallsh-is-missing-or-not-functioning.html). It seems the `intel-` rpm packages are the signal that tells installer \"I am here!\".\r\n\r\nAlso, I followed [can't install two versions of intel-mkl 2019.0.117 \u00b7 Issue #9713 \u00b7 spack/spack](https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/9713) and it turned out that is not the point.\r\n\r\nSo is there any way to install intel packages bypass the existing intel parallel studio? I can't uninstall existing version for custer stability.\r\n \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1. manually install intel parallel studio before intalling spack.\r\n\r\n2. intall any intel package using spack\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install intel-mpi\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.0\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-westmere\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
