    "body": "I am building a project that has exes that link to static libs on bgq using gcc. Our project uses a CMake-based build system.\r\n\r\nIn our build system I noticed I had to disable any RPATH related CMake settings to avoid relinking errors during install. \r\n\r\nWhen building with spack the issue reappeared b/c spack includes RPATH settings as part of `std_cmake_args`.\r\n\r\nI can easily filter the `std_cmake_args` related to RPATH for this case, but I suspect others may stumble over this. Not sure what the best solution would be for changing the install env.\r\n\r\n",
