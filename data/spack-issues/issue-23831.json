    "body": "The `spack info` output is the main source of package information for users, and thus the primary means for package authors to provide package/variant documentation to end users. \r\n\r\nCurrently the display code for `spack info` strips out newlines from description strings, which hinders efforts by package authors to format their package documentation in more readable ways. This happens in at least two notable places: \r\n\r\n1) The package description string, where paragraph breaks indicated by empty lines are removed and collapsed down to a single space.\r\n2) The variant description string, where hard-coded line breaks are converted to a single space.\r\n\r\nThe latter is especially bad for multi-valued variants, in cases where the meaning of each value is non-obvious and each value deserves an independent description. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nHere is part of the current output from `spack info gasnet`: (where the wrap varies based on terminal width)\r\n\r\n```\r\nVariants:\r\n    Name [Default]    Allowed values          Description\r\n    ==============    ====================    =======================================\r\n\r\n    conduits [smp]    none, udp, mpi, smp,    The hardware-dependent network backends\r\n                      ibv                     to enable.

Example output sketch:\r\n\r\n```\r\nVariants:\r\n    Name [Default]    Allowed values          Description\r\n    ==============    ====================    =======================================\r\n\r\n    conduits [smp]    one or more of:         The hardware-dependent network backends\r\n                                              to enable.
