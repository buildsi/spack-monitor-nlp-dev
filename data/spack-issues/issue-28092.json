    "body": "closes #21343\r\ncloses #18175\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new type of audit, triggered by:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack audit externals\r\n```\r\nthat verifies the detection of external packages. The overall mechanism is based on providing some metadata to mock the detection of software alongside the recipe in `package.py`. The PR is an alternative to the two at the top, that perform the same tests as unit tests. \r\n\r\n`spack audit externals` will be used in following PRs to replicate all the compiler detection unit tests at the level of each package providing a compiler. Moving these tests to packages is a required step towards compiler as dependencies.\r\n\r\n## Notes\r\nThe metadata in the PR is in the form of a YAML file called `detection_test.yaml`, rather than a literal dictionary in `package.py` as tried in #21343. This is because having seen both options I like the YAML file better as it doesn't bloat the recipe - but of course I'm open to change that if there's a strong consensus towards coding a literal dictionary.
