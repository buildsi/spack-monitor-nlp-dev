    "body": "Previously, modulefiles were not set with the same permissions as the package installation.\r\n\r\nFor world-readable packages, this would not cause a problem.\r\n\r\nFor group readable packages, it does\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n  mypackage:\r\n    permissions:\r\n      group: mygroup\r\n      read: group\r\n      write: group\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn this case, the modulefile is unreadable by members of the group other than the one who installed it.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds logic to the modulefile writers to set the permissions based on the configuration in `packages.yaml`",
