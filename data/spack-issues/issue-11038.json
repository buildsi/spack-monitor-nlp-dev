    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have a new environment which has Intel compilers installed to a system path that I dont have permissions to write to.\r\n\r\n    [fordemx@iforgehn4 defaults]$ spack compilers\r\n    ....\r\n    -- intel rhel6-x86_64 -------------------------------------------\r\n    intel@12.0.4\r\n    [fordemx@iforgehn4 defaults]$ which icc\r\n    /usr/local/intel/bin/icc\r\n\r\nI'd like to use this as a core with lmod, however since it wasn't compiled by spack, it doesn't generate a luafile for Core. Is there as way I can generate a lua for this specific installation of icc and which loads the appropriate env variables for a working spack env? I say this because I've run into some issues compiling say ncurses with the system installed version of icc as it complains about unwritable system paths eg.,: \r\n\r\n    /sbin/ldconfig: Can't create temporary cache file /etc/ld.so.cache~: Permission \r\n                 denied\r\n",
