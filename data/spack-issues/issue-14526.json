    "body": "Can't build Lua by itself.  It has multiple unrequired dependencies (Luarocks, ncurses, unzip, and readline) that relate to the extendable functionality.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nMy team's code is looking to add Lua input deck functionality but all the current dependencies are hard-coded and untoggleable in the Lua package.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTwo possible solutions:\r\n1) A variant that turns off the 3 depends_on and one resource.  Unfortunately this would break the extendable functionality of this package and would probably cause confusion.\r\n2) Pull all the extendable logic into a parent package that depends on the stand alone Lua package.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI have worked around this currently by commenting out most of the file but leaving \"extendable = True\" so that spack doesn't throw an error.",
