    "body": "This adds an explicit rule to ensure that concrete versions from an abstract spec are always concretizable.\r\n\r\nIt also removes `versions_weights` in favor of `version/3` that contains a package, a version and a weights. Using the same function avoids by design to infer the weight from a declaration and the actual version from another.\r\n\r\nRequire that all selected versions are declared either in `package.py`, `packages.yaml` or in an abstract_spec.\r\n\r\nCardinality constraints on compiler versions and platforms are reworked as integrity constraints, to avoid looping on 2 variables in the grounder.",
