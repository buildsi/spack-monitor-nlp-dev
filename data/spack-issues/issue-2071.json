    "body": "Fixes a concretization error and extends tests to cover this case in the future.\n\nSpecifically, concretization was failing if:\n- there were two or more providers of a spec\n- one of the providers was external\n- one of the providers had a version range in the when clause of its provides\n\nThe above conditions would lead to the concretizer comparing two specs that it expected to be names with versions, but instead were names with version ranges.  It was not equiped to handle this.\n",
