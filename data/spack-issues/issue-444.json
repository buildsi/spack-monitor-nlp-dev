    "body": "I need to propagate some variants to dependent packages. I wrote a small function depends_on_inherits to create the matrix of necessary depends_on calls. I think this is along the lines of what is suggested in https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spack/a4-G7IrXJ0E or at least partially. The python code is pretty straightforward. Thanks for considering!\n",
