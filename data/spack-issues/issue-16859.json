    "body": "Suite-sparse combines the `CFLAGS` values into `CF` macro.\r\nHowever, since `CF` is combined to the compile command during C++ compilation too,\r\nso if `CF` has options that C++ does not accept, an error occurs.\r\nThis error is the result of commit of https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/15500.\r\n\r\nThis fix creates a C++ only macro `CXXF` from `CF`. Modify to use `CXXF` when compiling C ++.\r\nAlso modify pgi.patch, which is affected by the above modification.",
