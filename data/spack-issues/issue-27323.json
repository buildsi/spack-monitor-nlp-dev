    "body": "As described in #13944 there are cases where CMake is unable to detect the MPI implementation or picks the wrong one (system-provided one), leading to inconsistencies. One way would be to manually set MPI_*_COMPILER args for CMake, but the CachedCMakePackage already does that (plus some CUDA-related things).\n\nTo discuss: the HIP-related CMake things could be moved to CachedCMakePackage as well. Has it converged enough to do it?\n",
