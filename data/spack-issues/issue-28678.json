    "body": "(Apologies in advance if this is obvious. I'm a new spack user who is trying to get started but was unable to find an answer to my question by other means.)\r\n\r\nIt appears that basic CLI commands are very slow. I have a single environment set up with ~6 packages. Spack CLI invocations that one would expect to run instantly take a while. E.g.:\r\n\r\n``` sh\r\n[sfp8544@snappy1 python-flux]$ time spack location -i cgal\r\n/home/sfp8544/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-ivybridge/gcc-9.1.0/cgal-5.3.1-negdj6dxxmey2o2rb4fkxugge77fxbsj\r\n\r\nreal    0m2.431s\r\nuser    0m1.032s\r\nsys     0m0.244s\r\n[sfp8544@snappy1 python-flux]$ time spack location -i cgal\r\n/home/sfp8544/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-ivybridge/gcc-9.1.0/cgal-5.3.1-negdj6dxxmey2o2rb4fkxugge77fxbsj\r\n\r\nreal    0m1.949s\r\nuser    0m1.036s\r\nsys     0m0.249s\r\n[sfp8544@snappy1 python-flux]$ time spack location -i cgal\r\n/home/sfp8544/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-ivybridge/gcc-9.1.0/cgal-5.3.1-negdj6dxxmey2o2rb4fkxugge77fxbsj\r\n\r\nreal    0m2.045s\r\nuser    0m0.908s\r\nsys     0m0.169s\r\n```\r\n\r\nAll spack commands that I've run have had a similarly painful wait time. This is on a reasonably powerful node. \r\n\r\nIs there some standard way to fix this? Again, apologies in advance if this is an obvious one!",
