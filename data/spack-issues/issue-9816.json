    "body": "As a packager I want to be able to strip arbitrary flags from any compilation phase so that I can remove those that prevent a package from building \"correctly\" without patching its build system.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nSpack already provides ways to inject flags into the compilation line, but currently lacks the counterpart: being able to strip arbitrary flags from it. This could be useful in cases where the build-system does not give any handle to remove a flag that prevent a package from building, or that compromise some of the guarantees that Spack gives.  A useful example is #9168 - and in fact this issue tracks a request for generalization done in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/9168#discussion_r217266215.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe idea is to add  a few more variables to those already managed by the compiler wrappers - see  https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/9168#discussion_r217266215. These variables should contain the flags that are to be stripped from the compilation line. Providing handles to set or modify the list of flags:\r\n1. From any compiler\r\n2. From any package\r\n3. From `packages.yaml` ?\r\n\r\nwould probably be a nice add-on. The precise API / configuration file syntax to use for this is still to be decided (and could probably be discussed directly in a PR).\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nThis is related to another request in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/9168#issuecomment-421330359 made by @skosukhin to be able to override any property of a compiler from `compilers.yaml`.",
