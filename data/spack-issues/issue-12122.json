    "body": "Fetch strategies: new global option `no_cache`, new git option `get_full_repo`.\r\n\r\n* All fetch strategies now accept the Boolean version keyword option `no_cache` in order to allow per-version control of cache-ability.\r\n* New git-specific version keyword option `get_full_repo` (Boolean). When true, disables the default `--depth 1` and `--single-branch` optimizations that are applied if supported by the git version and (in the former case) transport protocol.\r\n* The try / catch blog attempting `--depth 1` and retrying on failure has been removed in favor of more accurately ascertaining when the `--depth` option should work based on git version and protocol choice. Any failure is now treated as a real problem, and the clone is only attempted once.\r\n* Test improvements:\r\n * `mock_git_repository.checks[type_of_test].args['git']` is now specified as the URL (with leading `file://`) in order to avoid complaints when using `--depth`.\r\n * New type_of_test `tag-branch`.\r\n * mock_git_repository now provides `git_exe`.\r\n * Improved the action of the `git_version` fixture, which was previously hard-wired.\r\n * New tests of `--single-branch` and `--depth 1` behavior.\r\n* Add documentation of new options to the packaging guide.\r\n",
