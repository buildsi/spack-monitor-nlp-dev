This commit removes the Boost.with_default_variants to variants that packages are precisely dependent upon through build analysis conducted under @trws. This is the first batch of 20 packages with updated boost dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this PR is only the final commit (fe4e266) as the rest are part of #28623",
