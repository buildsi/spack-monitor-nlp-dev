    "body": "This PR makes the `tcl` package extendable just like any other scripting language provided by the Spack builtin repo. I was initially thinking about adding a `TclPackage` mixin class (just like `CudaPackage`) but the resulting type would have been too minimal to justify a core change (imho, seeking advice from @tgamblin @alalazo here):\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass TclPackage(Package):\r\n    extends('tcl')\r\n```",
