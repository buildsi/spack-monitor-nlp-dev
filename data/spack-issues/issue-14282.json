    "body": "print the recipe so a user can replicate what Spack does, outside of Spack\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThis would greatly help in replicating build problems when trying to debug a package, or permitting workarounds for build problems, or helping our users with \"here is a recipe to build that software in your home directory\"\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'd love to see output something like:\r\n```\r\nmycluster$ spack install --print-recipe libxml2\r\n## Spack: satisfying dependency libiconv with\r\n# spack install libiconv@1.16%gcc@8.3.0~static arch=cray-cnl7-haswell\r\n## Spack: satisfying dependency zlib with:\r\n# spack install zlib@1.2.11%gcc@8.3.0+optimize+pic+shared arch=cray-cnl7-haswell\r\n## Spack: stage directory is:\r\n# cd /path/to/stage/dir\r\n## Spack: fetching libxml2 with:\r\n# wget http://xmlsoft.org/sources/libxml2-2.9.9.tar.gz\r\n## Spack: verifying download with\r\n## (whatever commands compare sha256)\r\n## Spack: unpacking:\r\n# tar xzf libxml2-2.9.9.tar.gz\r\n## Spack: configuring\r\n# cd libxml2-2.9.9\r\n# ./configure --blah --blah --options-spack-uses \r\n## Spack: building\r\n# make -j 4\r\n## Spack: installing\r\n# make install\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThis is somewhat related to #10947 (support for --dry-run)\r\n",
