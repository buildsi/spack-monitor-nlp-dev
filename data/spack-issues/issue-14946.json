    "body": "I need to build packages for MacOS 10.12 (`sierra`) but sometimes they will be built in newer MacOS releases (with exactly the same compilers -custom built-, same SDK, same flags, same everything, generating exactly identical binaries --yep, I verified that).\r\n\r\nNow, if `spack` detects `highsierra`, it generates `highsierra` packages when installing. But I want to tell `spack` that even if the current OS is `highsierra`, the build results are actually `sierra`. How can I do that?\r\n\r\nI tried to specify the `os=sierra` flag when invoking `spack install` for a package, but, first of all, it didn't work (it says something like the specs are too different and that it's not possible to generate `sierra` installs), and second, it wouldn't be efficient for me having to use a flag for every install... I'd like to set this parameter globally for all my installs.\r\n\r\nI suppose this is related to cross-compiling features. But I wasn't able to find detailed documentation for cross-compiling in `spack` (yes, it's mentioned as a feature, and there are some slides on the concept, but didn't find a tutorial or documents explaining it).\r\n\r\nAs a related topic, I'd like to build **mingw-w64** with `spack`. There's no package yet for it, but I assume it could be similar to the existing `gcc` package. I've never built **mingw-w64** on my own (well, I've built it but using scripts from others), however I hope to understand all the steps from the port at Macports. If I'm able to generate a package for **mingw-w64**, how can I tell `spack` that the build results when using it are going to be `windows`? As I told, this seems similar to my question above about MacOS, with the difference that the builds using **mingw-w64** won't be able to be run natively on the host OS (well, I'll run them through a virtual machine, of course, but not natively).\r\n\r\nOf course, if you happen to have a preliminary **mingw-w64** package for `spack` for your internal use, it would be of great help if you could share it \ud83d\ude03 ",
