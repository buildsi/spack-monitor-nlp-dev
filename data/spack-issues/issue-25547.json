    "body": "### Summary\n\nWhen running the `spack install` command, an option should be available to specify a configuration scope from which to get build settings.\n\n### Rationale\n\nWhen an administrator is installing a package globally for all users on a system to access, but the administrator has a `~/.spack` directory containing configuration files for their own local packages, there is no way to install globally without removing or renaming the `~/.spack` directory.\n\n### Description\n\nI propose adding a `--scope=<scope>` flag to the `spack install` command that would allow a user to specify the configuration scope to pull variables from. If the flag is not provided, the current method should be used as the default.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
