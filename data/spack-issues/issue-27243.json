    "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nRStudio Desktop version is already present, but RStudio Server would be very useful to be installed on servers. I edited the my `spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/rstudio/package.py` file but installation does not work properly. Basically, I replaced the following rows:\r\n```\r\n            '-DRSTUDIO_TARGET=Desktop',\r\n            '-DRSTUDIO_PACKAGE_BUILD=Yes',\r\n```\r\nby:\r\n\r\n```\r\n            '-DRSTUDIO_TARGET=Server',\r\n            '-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release',\r\n```\r\nand added `libpam` as a dependency.\r\n\r\nHowever, it crashes at build phase.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.3-5220-25f1aad1c8\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.10\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
