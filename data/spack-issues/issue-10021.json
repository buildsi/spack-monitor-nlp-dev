    "body": "URL to source seems to have changed. \r\n\r\nIn addition, I added a new dependency on a fixed flex version if an old doxygen version shall be installed. The problem is that the version checker in code.l does only check subminor version but not minor version. Therefore the version checker thinks that flex@2.6.4 ist older than flex@2.5.33 for example. code.l could be patched but I did not think that it would it is worth the effort since it only affects the oldest doxygen version :-)",
