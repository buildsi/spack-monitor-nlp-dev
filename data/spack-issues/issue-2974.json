    "body": "This PR turns intel-mkl and intel-parallel-studio into scalapack providers...for most MPIs, anyway.\r\n\r\nA couple of things are iffy:\r\n\r\n- scalapack should be provided when ^mpi (is this valid?). There's a test for that later that raises an exception if there are no known MPI implementations in the spec, though.\r\n- It doesn't support Intel MPI because afaik there's no way to distinguish between ^intel-parallel-studio being pulled for Intel MPI or the rest of the stuff in the package. (including scalapack itself)",
