    "body": "Due to CMake's handling of compilers, linkers, archivers, etc., it can be harder to enable IPO/LTO by simply manipulating `CFLAGS`, `AR`, `RANLIB`, etc. than in autotools-based projects. The variable `CMAKE_INTERPROCEDURAL_OPTIMIZATION` has existed since CMake 3.9 to allow compilation with IPO/LTO more easily.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a standard `ipo` variant to CMake packages, defaulting to `False`, that allows users to control this variable. Enabling it possibly breaks some packages, but it defaults to off, so I don't think it should cause any problems.\r\n\r\nCloses #18373.",
