    "body": "I found an issue in the package `netlib-lapack` that may affect other packages as well.\r\n\r\nThe issue appears when `netlib-lapack` is configured with `+external-blas`: in that case the install method performs the spec query `spec['blas'].libs` here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/blob/dc8c8311c6d1c2f8989b0bac89176d48dcb59a41/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/netlib-lapack/package.py#L163-L167\r\n\r\nwhich due to incorrect resolution ends up calling `netlib-lapack`'s own `blas_libs` property which is incorrect. The incorrect resolution happens here:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/blob/dc8c8311c6d1c2f8989b0bac89176d48dcb59a41/lib/spack/spack/spec.py#L2765-L2772\r\n\r\nand it is due to the fact that `x.package.provides(name)` does not check any `when` conditions from the `provides` directives - in this case `netlib-lapack` provides `blas` only when the `external-blas` variant is disabled.",
