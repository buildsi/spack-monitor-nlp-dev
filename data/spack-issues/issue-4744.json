    "body": "Why does spack consume stdin?\r\n\r\nI did something like:\r\ncat list | while read pkg;do spack install $pkg;done\r\n\r\nand the loop terminated after one iteration because spack consumed all of stdin. To fix the problem I had to do:\r\n\r\ncat list | while read pkg;do spack install $pkg </dev/null;done\r\n\r\nCan we fix this? It is counter intuitive for someone writing scripts.",
