    "body": "Depends on the ldc package (#5279) that alalazo's working on.\r\n\r\nIt requires a patch to the Makefile because one of ldc's library functions mentions dlopen.  I *think* that ldc should be handling this.  See the discusssion in #5279.\r\n\r\nIt also requires a \"static\" ldc.  Again, see #5279.\r\n\r\nFinally, it needs \"undeaD\" as a resource, but I'm guessing at the appropriate release.  See lomereiter/sambamba#312.\r\n\r\nAlso need to investigate whether it requires `parallel=False` (`spack create` added that...).",
