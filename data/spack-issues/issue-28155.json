    "body": "The PR provides a configuration option that defines the type of a hash to be used by the spack-DB.  \r\n\r\nThe config option can be referenced by the projection option and create installation paths that include different hash-types. So, when hash_type='full_hash' spack supports multiple installations of the same package with different dependencies. Moreover, the lock mechanism uses the hash_type value to create the respective locks. Therefore, when hash_type='full_hash' spack supports concurrent installations of the same package with different dependencies. \r\n\r\nTo summarize, the lock mechanism, the spack-DB key values and, the directory prefixes should have a mechanism to control their behavior. This branch is an initial effort towards that direction. ",
