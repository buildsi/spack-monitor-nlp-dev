    "body": "Fixes #3072.\r\n\r\nFor some reason, on Comet, @eschnett wasn't able to build `mpc` because it was picking up the system `mpfr` installation. This PR explicitly tells `mpc` which directory to find its dependencies in.\r\n\r\nUnrelated change: I added version constraints to the dependencies. These come from [here](http://www.multiprecision.org/index.php?prog=mpc&page=download).",
