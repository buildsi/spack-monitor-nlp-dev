    "body": "Fixes #2251 (tests back to normal runtime)\r\n\r\n- Spack was automatically spidering remote URLs before creating a stage.\r\n- This might be useful but we don't want to do it unconditionally, as it slows down package creation and isn't usually necessary.  Also, we especially don't want to bother with it if the user asked to fetch from mirrors first.\r\n\r\n@alalazo @scheibelp ",
