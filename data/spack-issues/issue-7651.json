This PR implements his suggested fix.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that the default libs handler always added `lib` to the start of the package name, even when the package name already started with `lib`. This would result in `spec['libiconv'].libs` searching for `liblibiconv.so`. The solution is to only add `lib` when the package name doesn't start with `lib`.",
