    "body": "Currently the temporary folder where a package is build can be quite elaborated: `/private/var/folders/5k/sqpp24tx3ylds4fgm13pfht00000gn/T/davydden/spack-stage/spack-stage-k7EHWk/trilinos-12.4.2-Source`. That makes debugging build errors more difficult than it should. I think something like `/private/tmp/trilinos-12.4.2-<hash>` would be better.\n\nI would also suggest keeping build logs in some folder, i.e. `skack/logs` (separated for configure and build). The rationale is as follows: if the build is successful, the temporary folder gets deleted. But successful build does not yet mean correct build. Sometimes it is convenient to check configure stage of a package to see, say, what parts of the library were enabled/disabled. Good example is trilinos.\n",
