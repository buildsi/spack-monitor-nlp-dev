    "body": "This is an attempt to integrate new versions of pocl in the corresponding package. It should not be merged yet as I am still testing the new versions.\r\n\r\nSince the tarball URL has changed as part of the 1.0 release process, support for old 0.x versions of pocl now adds a bit of complexity.
