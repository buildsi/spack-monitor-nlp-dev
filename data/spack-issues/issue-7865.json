    "body": "These are packages specific to my work on climate and ice sheet modeling.  Most of them are developed by @citibeth or some of my close colleagues.  Not all of them can be publicly FTP'd at this point, although that will probably change within the next 6 months.\r\n\r\nAlthough these packages are not all generally useful, I would like to see them get merged anyway; as long as they conform to basic Spack standards for packages.  The software represented by these packages DOES need to be distributed beyond just my lab; and having it in the main Spack repo will make that process as easy and painless as possible.\r\n\r\nI have (or should have) listed myself as maintainer on all packages here.\r\n",
