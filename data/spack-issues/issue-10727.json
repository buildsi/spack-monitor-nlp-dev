    "body": "Previously, the post-install hook to set file-permissions obliterated the suid, sgit, and sticky bits.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes it to keep those bits. The logic is that the build system knows better than we do what they should be.\r\n\r\nIt also adds logic to throw an error if you try to install an suid binary with world write permissions.",
