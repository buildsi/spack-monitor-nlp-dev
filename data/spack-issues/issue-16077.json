    "body": "Spack attempts to inject it's paths just before the actual\r\nsystem include directories. Currently, if a build utilizes\r\n-isystem, Spack's headers will be injected using -I, and that\r\neffectively inserts them before any specified -isystem headers.\r\nThis leads to unexpected failures. Here, we assume that if a build\r\nattempts to use -isystem (implying that the underlying\r\ncompiler supports the flag) - we change to injecting the paths\r\ninto the end of the -isystem paths. There is a potential\r\nconcern if the build includes system paths in -I *and*\r\nuses -isystem, but I think that's probably an unlikely usage.\r\n\r\nSee:\r\n\r\nhttps://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/gcc/Directory-Options.html\r\n\r\nFixes #14488, Fixes #14234",
