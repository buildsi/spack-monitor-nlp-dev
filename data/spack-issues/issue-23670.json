    "body": "This PR updates the abinit package. The underlying build system has\r\nseveral changes from previous versions, which are reflected in the\r\npackage recipe.\r\n\r\n- added version 9.4.2\r\n- removed commented out code\r\n- add new libxml2 variant, with dependency and conflicts\r\n- add dependency on atompaw\r\n- depend on fftw-api when ~openmp\r\n  This allows other fftw implementations to be used. This PR adds MKL.\r\n- depend on netcdf explicitly\r\n- remove hdf5 variant as hdf5 is required\r\n- only use wannier90 if +mpi as the wannier90 spack package is MPI only\r\n- allow newer versions of libxc for abinit 9\r\n- split configure options for versions before and after abinit 9\r\n- always use MPI compiler wrappers\r\n- add patch to remove march settings for version 9",
