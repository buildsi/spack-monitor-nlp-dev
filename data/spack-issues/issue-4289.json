    "body": "@tmerrick1 @HenrikBengtsson @glennpj @JavierCVilla \r\n\r\nThis PR adds support for passing arbitrary arguments to the `INSTALL` method for `RPackage` via `--configure-args` and `--configure-vars`. Out of the 198 R packages in Spack, this is the first one that has even a slightly different install method (pretty impressive actually). This is a continuation of #4286.",
