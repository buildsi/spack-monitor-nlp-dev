    "body": "With this change, Spack's documentation now supports both Google and Numpy-style docstrings. The Napoleon extension for Sphinx acts as a preprocessor, converting Google/Numpy docstrings to classic rST docstrings. It's a little slower because of this, but it makes docstring documentation much more readable. See http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/ext/napoleon.html for details.\r\n\r\nFrom now on, we should encourage users to write docstrings in Google-style. If someone wants to be a hero and convert all existing docstrings to Google-style, be my guest.",
