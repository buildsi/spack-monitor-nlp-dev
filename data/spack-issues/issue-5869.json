    "body": "Configuring `libxcb` currently fails with the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nconfigure: error: Package requirements (pthread-stubs xau >= 0.99.2) were not met:\r\n\r\nPackage 'xproto', required by 'xau', not found\r\n\r\nConsider adjusting the PKG_CONFIG_PATH environment variable if you\r\ninstalled software in a non-standard prefix.\r\n\r\nAlternatively, you may set the environment variables NEEDED_CFLAGS\r\nand NEEDED_LIBS to avoid the need to call pkg-config.\r\nSee the pkg-config man page for more details.\r\n```\r\n\r\nIn other words, `xproto` is needed at the configure stage of `libxcb`, even though it's not a direct dependency, but a dependency of a dependency (`libxau`).\r\n\r\nLeaving aside the philosophical issue whether a configure script checking for a dependency's dependency is something that should be done at all, from Spack's point of view, I think the cleanest solution is just to include `xproto` as a direct dependency of `libxcb`:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dlukes/spack/commit/ad88ba0c3006c512aedf6fb5f181c91585eeb97e\r\n\r\nWhich it effectively currently is anyway, because of the configure script :)",
