    "body": "Hi\r\n\r\nMaybe I need to delete my repository.  I have three local branches but I cannot figure out how to get rid of my commit history.  I reset head back to upstream but then I am not able to push to my remote branches without merging from my origin which again has the stuff I do not want.   Noob error, obviously.\r\n\r\nAnyway, I have added R 3.4.0.  It was built successfully on Centos 6.8 and 7.3",
