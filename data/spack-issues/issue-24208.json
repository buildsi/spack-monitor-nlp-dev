    "body": "This makes it easier to bootstrap compilers by specifying paths relative to the spack install or environment view. This way we can commit a portable bootstrapped compiler config.  (We've tried used `install_missing_compilers` but couldn't get it to work very well. The goal is to be able to clone our custom spack repo and build everything without additional configuration changes.)",
