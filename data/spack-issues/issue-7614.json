    "body": "Fixes #7613. @ch741\r\n\r\n@alalazo @lee218llnl @tgamblin we might have a problem on our hands. The once venerable https://pypi.io links are no longer working for the SCons package. There is currently no evidence that this affects any other Python package, but we might need to consider alternative download methods in the future. This may require #2718. If done correctly, a `PyPIFetchStrategy` could also allow us to hook into `spack versions` and provide a list of available versions.\r\n\r\nAlso added the latest version of SCons. It looks like they finally support Python 3. Successfully installed with Python 3.6.4 and Clang 9.0.0 on macOS 10.13.3.",
