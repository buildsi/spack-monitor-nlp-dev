    "body": "Also added `py-nbconvert@6.4.2` but unfortunately I can't test it. No version of `py-nbconvert@5:` can be concretized due to conflicting versions of flit-core that are required. This issue could be solved by separate concretization of build deps. We could also split the package into separate packages for each version like I did with jupyter-packaging, but I'd rather not do that.\r\n\r\nSince `py-nbconvert` concretizes to `@4` by default, and since `@4` isn't compatible with newer versions of `py-tornado`, I've locked down the correct dependency version range.",
