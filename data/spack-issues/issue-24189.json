    "body": "According to the docs, r is needed for plotting, but plotting is\r\nuntested. In addition, the specific version requirement of java for gatk\r\ncould lead to multiple installations of r being triggered in an\r\nenvironment. That might cause people to have to be deliberate about\r\njava in a deployment. All in all, it seems that r is better as a\r\nvariant for gatk.",
