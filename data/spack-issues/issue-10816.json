    "body": "Replace the currently used os.environ by a reference environment to\r\ncatch modifications done by users.\r\n\r\nBackground: we've observed that our module for the `intel` package\r\nincludes a `unsetenv PS1` when building the module with Jenkins. I could\r\nlocally reproduce that by executing `export PS1=foo` on the local shell\r\nbefore regenerating the intel module. With this fix, the environments\r\ncompared are closer together.",
