    "body": "Currently in `boost/package.py` we specify manually every library we want to build. This means that whenever we update the version number we also need to update the list of libraries / variants to be consistent with boost release notes.\n\nBuilding `boost@1.61` with all the variants but `graph` set to `True` gives : \n\n```\nComponent configuration:\n\n    - atomic                   : building\n    - chrono                   : building\n    - container                : not building\n    - context                  : not building\n    - coroutine                : not building\n    - coroutine2               : not building\n    - date_time                : building\n    - exception                : not building\n    - filesystem               : building\n    - graph                    : not building\n    - graph_parallel           : not building\n    - iostreams                : building\n    - locale                   : building\n    - log                      : building\n    - math                     : building\n    - metaparse                : not building\n    - mpi                      : building\n    - program_options          : building\n    - python                   : building\n    - random                   : building\n    - regex                    : building\n    - serialization            : building\n    - signals                  : building\n    - system                   : building\n    - test                     : building\n    - thread                   : building\n    - timer                    : not building\n    - type_erasure             : not building\n    - wave                     : building\n```\n\nmeaning that in the last versions of `boost` we missed to update the list of libraries we need to build.\n",
