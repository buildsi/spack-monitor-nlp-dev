    "body": "This PR is composed of two minor changes to the `Spec` class, along with two further distinct changes which I would like some review on:\r\n1. Add type annotations to `Spec.__init__()`.\r\n2. Correctly implement `Spec.__repr__()` to return a string which can be `eval()`ed to produce the same object.\r\n\r\n### Desired Feedback\r\n- [ ] Are these types correct?\r\n- [ ] Is this `repr()` impl more correct? Is there a specific reason we were breaking the `repr()` contract by calling `str()` before?",
