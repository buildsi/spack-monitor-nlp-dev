    "body": "Here's a preliminary PR for the tensorflow package (we're still working on the two non-default build variants).\n\nTensorflow is built using the bazel build tool.\nBazel pulls in dependencies (cf. [WORKSPACE](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/WORKSPACE) file) for the build process;\nthese dependencies are installed to the same prefix directory as tensorflow (i.e. similar to what python setuptools does).\n\nShould we try to integrate all dependencies into spack first?\n",
