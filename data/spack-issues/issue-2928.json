    "body": "Fixes #2760\r\n\r\nWhen copying a spec, _concrete is always set to False for each\r\ndependency. \"Spec.satisfies\" was accessing the member \"_concrete\"\r\ndirectly instead of using the property \"concrete\". This means that\r\nif you copy a spec, the dependencies will be considered equal, but\r\ndid not necessarily satisfy one another. Spec.satisfies is a\r\nprerequisite for a package to be considered an extension; as a\r\nconsequence, an extension with run-time dependencies that were also\r\nextensions did not activate those extensions. This updates\r\nSpec.satisfies to avoid checking the cached member \"_concrete\"\r\ndirectly.",
