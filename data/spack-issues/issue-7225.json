    "body": "Prior to this commit, running `spack module refresh` with `gdbm`\r\ninstalled throws the warning:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n==> Warning: Could not write module file [/Users/oxberry1/spack/share/spack/lmod/darwin-sierra-x86_64/Core/gdbm/1.14.1.lua]\r\n==> Warning:    --> global name 'spack_cc' is not defined <--\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis warning is repeated for every `gdbm` installation in Spack.\r\n\r\nThe cause of the issue seems to be the same as in spack/spack (#6089):\r\nusing `spack_cc`, `spack_cxx`, or similar inside `configure_args`\r\ncauses the warnings to throw when module files are generated.\r\n\r\nMoving the use of `spack_cc` into `setup_environment` seems to fix the\r\nproblem, even though it's a bit of a kludge.\r\n\r\nI've tested this commit both on my MacBook Pro with clang@8.1.0-apple and gcc@7.3.0, and on RHEL 7 with intel@16.0.3 (which uses gcc@4.9.3), and #5892 does not recur (it is still fixed).",
