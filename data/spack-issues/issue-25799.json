The bootstrapping process is done by\r\n\r\n1. acquiring a single file version of fpm (curl)\r\n2. compiling this single file version to a bootstrap binary with reduced capabilities (FC)\r\n3. use this bootstrap binary to build the actual fpm version (FC + CC)\r\n\r\nThis functionality is provided by the `install.sh` script in the fpm source tarball.",
