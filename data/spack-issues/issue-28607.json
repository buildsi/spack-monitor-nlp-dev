    "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\n`spack install` should print an overview of what it will install.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWhen I `spack install` a package, I would like to get an idea what is going to happen before committing to wait possibly hours for the installation to complete.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThis is what I would like to know in advance:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Which packages will get installed from source?\r\n- [ ] Which dependencies are already installed, reused from external/upstream install trees, or loaded from binary caches?\r\n- [ ] Why are these packages needed? (A tree-style output would be useful, similar to `spack spec -I`)\r\n\r\nThen, during the installation, I would also like to know this:\r\n\r\n- [ ] What is the concrete spec that is being installed? (Currently only the package id like `cmake-3.22.1-6gtxk6hg76hdq4cd2tn2r4skt2cwfsao` is printed out. Instead it would be nice to see `cmake@3.22.1@13.0.0~doc+ncurses+openssl+ownlibs~qt build_type=Release`)\r\n- [ ] Where am I in the ongoing installation? (E.g. print a progress indicator like `[3 / 54]`)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nSome of this information is reported by `spack spec -I`, so I often run this before a `spack install`. However, the information is not complete. For instance, `spack spec` does not take test dependencies into account.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
