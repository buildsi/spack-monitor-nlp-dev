    "body": "I created a python package for mpltools. When I add this package to an environment, it is not accessible to python. However, when I use `spack load py-mpltools` everything works as expected.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if the issue is related to the upstream `setup.py`, or my spack package. The spack package I created can be found [here](https://github.com/jacobmerson/spack/blob/a67bf0ca77b33f742c4650c6b4ba5e64739266ff/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/py-mpltools/package.py)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack env activate mypy # py-mpltools not active after loading an environment with the package in it\r\n$ spack load py-mpltools # py-mpltools is now accessible\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nNo errors reported, stacktrace looks normal. However, py-mpltools is not accessible when running python.\r\n```console\r\n$ python3 -c \"import mpltools\"\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"<string>\", line 1, in <module>\r\nModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'mpltools'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-31-a67bf0ca7\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-broadwell\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\nI use the external python 3.8.5 installation with ubuntu 20.04\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart \r\n",
