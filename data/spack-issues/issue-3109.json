    "body": "I'm trying to add my first python packages to Spack and I've realized that for some versions their tarfiles are located twice in PyPI with different urls. \r\n\r\nExample with 4Suite-xml (both exist):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/packages/source/4/4Suite-XML/4Suite-XML-1.0.2.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nand \r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/packages/0e/ae/3c5b4fffb12be7c3a80c99475853349e1cf8477f99051921ea06fbf5e3b9/4Suite-XML-1.0.2.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever, for others the more recent versions are only in the second type of url (IMHO, ugly to put in the package.py because of the length and numbers, I know, it's just a detail, but I would like to know why this difference between packages).\r\n\r\nExample with lxml (only one url works):\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/packages/66/45/f11fc376f784c6f2e77ffc7a9d02374ff3ceb07ede8c56f918939409577c/lxml-3.7.2.tar.gz#md5=8dcf8d6c692b7aed9370f7462ff09935\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut not in:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/packages/source/l/lxml/lxml-3.7.2.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhereas its older versions are:\r\n\r\n```\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/packages/source/l/lxml/lxml-2.3.tar.gz \r\n```\r\n\r\nBoth 4Suite-XML-1.0.2 and lxml-2.3 are very old, so was there any change in the PyPI allocation policy or does it follow some rules that I'm missing?",
