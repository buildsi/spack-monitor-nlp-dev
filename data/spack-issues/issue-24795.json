    "body": "The previous code improperly copied specs in a way that invalidated all of the cached hashes, and then had a bug that cleared caches only for the root and not other nodes affected by the splice.\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the splice method to properly retain/invalidate all cached hashes through the DAG of the result.\r\n\r\nMaking the package content hash a cached value of the spec allows us to recompute full hashes without needing access to the full provenance from package write time.\r\n\r\nIncludes unit test.",
