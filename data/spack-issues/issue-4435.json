    "body": "Mono's vendor'ed boringssl interacts badly with openssl, so you need to use `cmake~openssl`.\r\n\r\nLeft to its own devices, it wants to refer to things in `/usr/share/.mono`.  Applications seem to try to write there but it's not usually writable by non-root users.  If you install this as-is, you'll need to create the directory and arrange for it to be writable as necessary.  This package includes a variant to redirect those paths to `prefix.share`, which is more likely to be writable by the Spack installer.\r\n\r\nThis package works for my non-trivial test cases, but there's a lot of ground to cover.\r\n\r\nI do not have a use case, so at the moment I have no plans for including the graphics library (GDI).",
