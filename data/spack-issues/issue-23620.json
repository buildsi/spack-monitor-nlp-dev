    "body": "ORNLA reported one issue with hipMalloc3D and hipMallocPitch() calls failing in spack environment on rocm-4.1.0. \r\nThis was reproduced on the previous releases also. The issue stems from the fact that ROCr reports no support for images, hence HIP runtime doesn't populate many of the image info fields.  Based on inputs from the HIP team, this flag should be enabled.\r\nI have retested the sample program sent with the hipMalloc3D() and hipMallocPitch and enabling the flag. I do not see the failure now.",
