That said, attempting to do the same for mpich failed. After adding: \r\n```python\r\n    def setup_environment(self, spack_env, run_env):\r\n        # mpich configure fails when F90 and F90FLAGS are set\r\n        spec = self.spec\r\n        spack_env.unset('F90')\r\n        spack_env.unset('F90FLAGS')\r\n```\r\nto the `package.py` failed to unset `F90` which was set by the spack produced gcc@8.2.0 module. Changing `compilers.yaml` not to use the module seemed to solve the issue, though now `F90` is unset when other packages seek it out.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
