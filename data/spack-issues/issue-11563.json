    "body": "I downloaded the binary version of llvm (6.0.0, 7.0.0, and 8.0.0) from the official llvm website, and made them available to spack (for reference: I put them into `$SPACK_ROOT/clang-X.X.X`)\r\n\r\nWhenever I try to link anything compiled with spack, I get the following warnings:\r\n```\r\nld64.lld: warning: ignoring unknown argument: -headerpad_max_install_names\r\nld64.lld: warning: ignoring unknown argument: -search_paths_first\r\nld64.lld: warning: ignoring unknown argument: -headerpad_max_install_names\r\nld64.lld: warning: -sdk_version is required when emitting min version load command.  Setting sdk version to match provided min version\r\n```\r\nThese seem to be added by the `clang` wrapper by default on `darwin`, but they are not supported by the official distribution.\r\n\r\nThis happens also after compiling `llvm` from within spack, then adding the compiled clang as a new compiler (e.g.: spack compiler add `spack find llvm`), and trying to link with it.\r\n",
