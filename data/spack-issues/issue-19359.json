    "body": "### Rationale\r\n\r\nI'm trying out the new environment dev-build / develop feature, and I think it's great, so thanks a lot @becker33 :).\r\n\r\nTwo points of general feedback:\r\n\r\n1. I can't seem to build two different specs of the same package in a single environment. Seems like a limitation of using keys instead of an array in the `develop` section of an environment file. \r\n\r\n2. It would be great to be able to specify the build directory, since I might want to build out of source with a folder name that I can specify myself\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  view: false\r\n  specs:\r\n    - sirius@develop-a ^openblas threads=openmp\r\n    - sirius@develop-b ^intel-mkl\r\n  develop:\r\n    sirius:\r\n      path: path/to/SIRIUS-branch-a\r\n      spec: sirius@develop-a\r\n    sirius: # oops\r\n      path: path/to/SIRIUS-branch-b\r\n      spec: sirius@develop-b\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMaybe an alternative & more condensed structure would be:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  view: false\r\n  specs:\r\n    - sirius@develop-a ^openblas threads=openmp\r\n    - sirius@develop-b ^intel-mkl\r\n  develop:\r\n    - spec: sirius@develop-a\r\n      path: path/to/SIRIUS-branch-a\r\n      build_directory: ./SIRIUS-a\r\n    - spec: sirius@develop-b\r\n      path: path/to/SIRIUS-branch-b\r\n      build_directory: ./SIRIUS-b\r\n```",
