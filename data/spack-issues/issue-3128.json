    "body": "When I run `python`, I get readline support, which enables me to do things like use the arrow keys to go left/right or cycle forward/backward through my history, just as you would expect from your terminal shell.\r\n\r\nWhen I run `spack python`, I don't seem to get this support, and the arrow keys are converted to meta characters:\r\n```\r\n$ spack python\r\nSpack version 0.10.0\r\nPython 2.7.12, Darwin x86_64\r\n>>> print('hello world')^[[D^[[A^[[B^[[C\r\n  File \"<console>\", line 1\r\n    print('hello world')\r\n                        ^\r\nSyntaxError: invalid syntax\r\n```\r\nAny idea why?",
