    "body": "This is a bit of an addendum to https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/9522 . I originally created all these packages in this PR. I realized some of the optional libraries for Nalu-Wind like Tioga and OpenFAST were still set to build static libraries (Nalu had a previous requirement of all static libraries). So I am defaulting them to shared now, and I also added `pic` variants in case the shared/static mix happens somehow, so then it doesn't fail with \"relocatable\" errors telling the user to use `-fPIC` if some library winds up static.",
