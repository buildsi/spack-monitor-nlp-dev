    "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThis small PR tries to address issue #14679 .\r\nThe first part of the error came from the file `wcslib.h` being located in `<wcslib-prefix>/include/wcs.h` instead of `<wcslib-prefix>/include/wcslib/wcs.h`.\r\n\r\nI tried to use the `find_headers()` function and mimic what was in done for the `OpenMPI` package.py file.\r\nBut I am unable to make it work.\r\n\r\nI also can't seem to use `debug_print()` or `print()` to see in the shell if my changes are actually being read.\r\n\r\nDo you have any suggestions?\r\nThanks,\r\nDiana",
