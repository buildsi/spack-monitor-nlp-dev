When I then run `spack install` it reports an error in stdout or stderr, but it does not set an exit code (note that this happens to be in the fish shell, so I'm using `$status` rather than `$?`).\r\n\r\nThis is problematic in scripted or CI environments because it is tricky to tell if the installation succeeded or not.\r\n\r\nThe problem is similar to https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/20510, but I'm guessing this must be a different code path.\r\n\n\n### Error message\n\nThe error message looks fine to me; the problem is the exit status of the command.\n\n### Information on your system\n\n```console\r\ncarns@carns-x1-7g ~/tmp> spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.3-4911-c48b733773\r\n* **Python:** 3.9.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu21.04-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n```\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
