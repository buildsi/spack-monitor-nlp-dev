    "body": "+ While installing a package that requires `py-h5py` but doesn't want mpi, I discovered that the no-mpi variant didn't behave as expected.  Here are the changes that I made to allow `~mpi` to work:\r\n  + This update does not change default behavior.  However, if the `~mpi` variant of `py-h5py` is requested, the concretizer should should pick `hdf5~mpi` to eliminate the `+mpi` dependency that is defaulted to `true` in `hdf5/package.py`.\r\n  + For the `~mpi` variant, the environment variable `HDF5_DIR` is still required.  I moved this command out of the `+mpi` conditional.",
