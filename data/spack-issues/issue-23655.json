    "body": "This is a find-replace job for a lot of different ways to express `self.define_from_variant('foo', 'bar')`. I'm not sure if the best approach to this is to do one huge merge request and try to ping all 83 packages that this touched... or to just have a couple people spot check and address potential issues as they crop up.\r\n\r\nThere's a possibility that this will cause some package recipes to fail by exposing previously hidden typos due to `'+nonexistent_variant' in spec` returning `False` rather than raising an error.",
