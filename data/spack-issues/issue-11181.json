    "body": "fixes #11159 \r\n\r\nThis PR forbids the assignment of custom super-namespaces for `Repo` and `RepoPath`, as the only super-namespace supported by package directives is `spack.pkg`. \r\n\r\nIt also adds a few minor maintenance changes:\r\n- [x] Using `functools.wrap` for the `autospec decorator\r\n- [x] Remove unused arguments from `RepoPath.get`\r\n- [x] Move directory cleanup in `create_repo` before raising (the code was unreachable before)",
