    "body": "This bit me because `coreutils` all of a sudden didn't \"work\" -- the commands all had a `g` prefix.  This PR makes that optional, for those of us who *want* them to override other things on `$PATH`.\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a `gprefix` variant to coreutils, so that the 'g' prefix on binaries is optional.\r\n- [x] Make un-prefixed binaries the default again\r\n\r\n@DiegoMagdaleno this reverts the default behavior  added in #15883.  If we merge this, you'll need to use `coreutils+gprefix`",
