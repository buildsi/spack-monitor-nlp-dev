    "body": "Before the flags used where the one for llc, the underlying compiler from LLVM IR to machine assembly. It turns out that the semantic of `-march`, `-mtune` and `-mcpu` changes from clang front-end to llc.\r\n\r\nI found no definitive reference for the flags submitted in this PR, but I checked the assembly on a vectorizable function using [Godbolt's web-site](https://godbolt.org/z/S9yFwU).\r\n\r\nRefers to the discussion in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/13825#discussion_r351107265 (thanks @t-karatsu !)",
