    "body": "libuuid is currently contained in util-linux, libuuid and uuid. This change introduces a new virtual provider `uuid` and renames the existing `uuid` package to `ossp-uuid`.\r\n\r\nutil-linux's libuuid is provided in the form of a separate package util-linux-uuid to make sure that packages depending on uuid and util-linux can use a separate uuid implementation, which the concretizer does not allow if libuuid is contained in util-linux.\r\n\r\nFixes #10812",
