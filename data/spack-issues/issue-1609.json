    "body": "The Score-P package requires a case-sensitive file system. This is described in the install notes, and I confirmed with the developers. I suggest to disable Score-P on Darwin to avoid others having to track down this problem in the same way I had to. Alternatively, we can add an install-time test whether the build or install directories are on a case-insensitive file system.\n",
