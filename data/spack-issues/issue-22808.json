    "body": "The problem that was reported and fixed in #21900 has been reintroduced in #22737 (#19316).\r\n\r\nIt looks like the quick fix mentioned in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/21900#issuecomment-810741473 was a bit too quick. This PR should cover both cases.\r\n\r\n@becker33 @white238 I am very curious why `axom` requires `hdf5` to be configured with `--with-zlib=/zlib/prefix`. Could you, please, give some details on that? Thank you.\r\n\r\nThe only explanation I can come up with is that there is a `libz.la` file somewhere on the system, which would be strange since `zlib` is not a libtool package.\r\n\r\n",
