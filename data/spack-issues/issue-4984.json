In 1.54 it was 64, it bumped once or twice afterwards and in 1.59 ([this commit][commit]) it became dynamic.\r\n\r\nI need 1.54 for as a prereq for bcl2fastq but I can't build it on my 144 core build box because make_jobs is 144.\r\n\r\nThis fixes that.\r\n\r\n[commit]: https://github.com/boostorg/build/commit/316e26ca718afc65d6170029284521392524e4f8",
