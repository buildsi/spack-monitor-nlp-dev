    "body": "### Problem\r\nI made a mistake in #21720 when I created a neighboring `typing_extensions.py` file with the contents of `typing_extensions` and didn't add any code testing it. That caused #22235 to begin raising errors.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nI'm not at all sure why this is failing, but keeping the original setup @trws had with everything just in `typing.py` seems to work. This PR adds a single use of `TYPE_CHECKING` in order to avoid regressions before #22235 is merged.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\nWe can now import `TYPE_CHECKING` again!",
