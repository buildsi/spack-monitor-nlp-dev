    "body": "History:\r\n- Initial pull request is raised to add AOCC support for CloverLeaf (#25106), \r\n\r\n> from @adamjstewart: Instead of patching master, why not contribute the patch upstream so that everyone can benefit from it?  \r\n\r\nAs per the community comments, we up streamed the patch with `CloverLeaf_ref `source code (https://github.com/UK-MAC/CloverLeaf_ref/pull/7),  AOCC specific changes are now available in `Cloverleaf_ref@master` branch whereas in Spack recipe `Cloverleaf@master` refers `CloverLeaf_ref@b5e598d`, So, this branch will not have AOCC support as it was released 15 months back.\r\n\r\nThis pull request applies a patch onto the `Cloverleaf@master`  to extend AOCC support until new version of `Cloverleaf_ref `with AOCC support is released \r\n\r\n",
