    "body": "Have you ever stared at the verbose output of a Spack build and lost track of where you were in the build process? Have you ever wished you could simply jump to the next stage in your terminal and see how the tests are progressing? With this PR, the future is now!\r\n\r\nSimply use the macOS Terminal mark feature to jump between prompts using Cmd+Up/Down. See below .gif for a demonstration.\r\n\r\n![mark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/12021217/57988005-7fb33700-7a4e-11e9-8516-49ce9575f657.gif)\r\n\r\nThis works by calling the `osascript` command on macOS to insert a mark. Credits to [Armin Briegel](https://scriptingosx.com/2017/03/terminal-the-marks-the-spot/) for figuring out how to do this.",
