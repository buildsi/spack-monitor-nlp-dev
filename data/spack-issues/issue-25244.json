    "body": "Multipart uploads are not assembled to a single file on openstack\r\nobject storage, instead they are stored as Static Large Object. This is rather\r\ninconvenient, because it means there is not a single URL for the file;\r\ninstead the user has to download all parts and assemble the file\r\nthemselves. This makes spack install using a binary cache over https://\r\ninstead of s3:// fail.\r\n\r\nTo work around this, this commit ensures that we use a high multipart\r\nthreshold of 1TB, which basically means we never use multipart uploads.\r\n",
