    "body": "The recipe previously did not include -DWITH_JASPER as something that could be specified one way or the other.\r\nOther edits:\r\n * BUILD_IPP_IW is BUILD instead of WITH; it was in a different section of the CMakeLists.txt. Move it to the top, as that section is before the one with the WITHs\r\n * Several options were missing :BOOL\r\n * -DWITH_ZLIB doesn't actually exist as an option\r\n\r\n(I'm just going to hope that the options in the opencv recipe previously are the only ones people want, there is a _lot_ of potential busywork there)",
