    "body": "Well, it's finally happened. I've gone crazy enough to volunteer to maintain all Python packages in Spack.\r\n\r\nAlso adding @skosukhin as a maintainer for `python`. He volunteered in #16527 but it's taking longer than I would like to get that PR merged. Let me know if you or anyone else would like to join me on maintaining the entire `PythonPackage` base class and all packages that extend it.",
