    "body": "Adds versions+sha256 hashes for linux-headers versions\r\n2.6.19.1 through 5.13.13 (current).  Earlier versions\r\nadded and commented out as the headers_install target\r\nwasn't available back then.\r\n\r\nAdds generate-versions.sh to allow mostly-automatic\r\nregeneration of versions as new kernels are created.\r\n\r\nModifies \"spack versions\" to prevent spidering, as that\r\nscales poorly to thousands of tarballs. Returns and\r\nempty dictionary instead.  Definitely a temporary solution.",
