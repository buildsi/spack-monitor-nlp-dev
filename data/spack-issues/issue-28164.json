    "body": "VecGeom 1.1.18 requires *exactly* version 0.8.0 of VecCore, which hasn't been tagged. The CMake logic inside VecGeom silently overrides the \"disable vendored copy\" option that spack sets, so vecgeom@1.1.18 always ends up installing a vendored copy of veccore alongside vecgeom. This causes a conflict when building an environment with the spack-provided (but ignored) version of veccore, leading downstream packages to choke:\r\n```\r\nCMake Error at /rnsdhpc/code/spack/opt/spack/apple-clang/cmake/7zgbrwt/share/cmake-3.22/Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:47 (find_package):\r\n  Could not find a configuration file for package \"VecCore\" that is\r\n  compatible with requested version \"0.8.0\".\r\n\r\n  The following configuration files were considered but not accepted:\r\n\r\n    /rnsdhpc/code/spack/var/spack/environments/celeritas/.spack-env/view/lib/cmake/VecCore/VecCoreConfig.cmake, version: 0.6.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n@drbenmorgan I recommend respecting the `BUILTIN_VECCORE` option in VecGeom if defined, and officially tagging 0.8.0 of VecCore so that it's available.",
