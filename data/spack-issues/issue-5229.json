    "body": "This PR introduces a new descriptor in the `llnl.util.lang` module, that intercepts the assignments and updates automatically the reference an attribute maintains to its current owner. This aims to be more\r\ndeclarative on the nature of certain attributes of `Spec` and ensure a safer refactoring of those parts.\r\n\r\nSuggestions for better naming are welcome.",
