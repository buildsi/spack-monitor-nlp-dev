    "body": "*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*\r\nSoftware packages that can be built by Spack have their own licenses. It would be nice to have a way of providing that license information in the corresponding Spack package script.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\nUsers who build against a given package are impacted by the license governing that software. It would be more convenient if Spack could include that information, along with a simple command line method for reporting it, so that users don't have to track it down on the package's web site.\r\n\r\n*Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it!*\r\nThere is a potential that users could mistakenly assume that a package built by Spack was under the \r\nSpack license, and inadvertently link their software to a package that has implications for its distribution.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nI believe one could add a simply line similar to the current identifier:\r\n```\r\nSPDX-License-Identifier: (Apache-2.0 OR MIT)\r\n```\r\nthat identifies the underlying package's license. A Python script could perhaps scrape that information for printout when requested by a user, or some other mechanism employed.\r\n",
