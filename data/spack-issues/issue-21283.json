    "body": "Merging a PR removes part of commit messages, it only keeps the first line.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n- original commit in PR: https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/21267/commits/8f8a2a55d31e60169d9075dd1a760d4ca9fbd625\r\n- final commit in tree: https://github.com/spack/spack/commit/7bed6a7077dcaed2b2400e2c437967124cc227ae\r\n\r\nThis is a shame because the commit message is typically relevant information that should be recorded as part of the history, for future users to be able to understand what happened. It's frustrating to spend time on commit messages only to have it discarded when the PR is merged.\r\n\r\nI understand the rationale of squashing commits when merging, it allows to \"clean up\" PRs that have many fix-up commits. But it should still keep the full commit messages, especially when a PR only has a single commit.",
