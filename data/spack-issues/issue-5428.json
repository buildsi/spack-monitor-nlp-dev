Eg, as pseudo-code\r\n\r\n    depend_on('openmpi+thread_multiple', when=\"(mpi is openmpi)\")\r\n\r\nAdding this into `~/.spack/packages.yaml` isn't really an option since this doesn't work very well when distributing the package and would be rather error-prone.\r\n\r\nWhat solutions are available?\r\n\r\nI've tagged the usual suspects: @adamjstewart  @tgamblin @alalazo \r\n\r\n",
