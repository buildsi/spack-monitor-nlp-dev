    "body": "@tgamblin @adamjstewart @alalazo @davydden \r\n\r\nThe proposal is that when Spack encounters `depends_on('python@xxx', type='build')`, that it will satisfy that dependency with the Python being used to run Spack (if the version of that Python matches the requested spec), rather than a Spack-built Python.  This will eliminate some circular dependency problems we've been having, and also eliminate the need to build a whole Python, just as a build dependency for other packages.\r\n\r\nI'd like to know... is this something we can agree on to get implemented?  I would only work on it if we know it's something we want.",
