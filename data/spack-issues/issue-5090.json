    "body": "closes #4275 \r\n\r\nThis PR creates the ```cpu_target``` variant for openblas. We had the issue of building openblas on cluster nodes which had a more modern CPU architecture, with the architecture specific optimisations automatically turned on. This lead to ```illegal instruction``` failures (e.g., in matplotlib) on the frontends.",
