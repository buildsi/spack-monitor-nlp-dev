    "body": "`spack install root%gcc@5.2.0 ^python@3.6.2` cannot get past CMake step because it cannot find `python` as a reference to `python@3.6.2` rather than system python. I found this on RHEL6 machine with Python2.6, which is not compatible with root 6.08.06. Where should this be fixed? Making a symlink in `python3` to `python` or inside `root`?",
