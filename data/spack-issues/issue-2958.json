    "body": "Send a new PR after #2957 is closed.\r\n\r\nAs discussed in #2716 , HTTP/HTTPS retrieval URLs work better behind a firewall. This commit repalcse FTP retrieval URLs with HTTP ones serving packages with identical checksum. Luckily, all FTP urls in spack packages seem to have alternative HTTP/HTTPS urls.\r\n\r\nThese chages have been made manually and no checksum changes are made. Tests run sucessfully against spack test package.\r\n\r\nTo proceed, I plan to add a test in package_sanity to check if HTTP/HTTPS is favored over FTP when HTTP/HTTPS is available for the retrieval site.",
