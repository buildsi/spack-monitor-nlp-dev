    "body": "This fixes part of the problem mentioned in #3690, the fact that \"Successfully uninstalled\" prints twice for the same hash:\r\n```\r\n$ spack uninstall automake\r\n==> The following packages will be uninstalled:\r\n\r\n-- linux-fedora25-x86_64 / gcc@6.2.1 ----------------------------\r\nzwtptzu automake@1.15%gcc\r\n\r\n==> Do you want to proceed? [y/N] y\r\n==> Successfully uninstalled automake@1.15%gcc@6.2.1 arch=linux-fedora25-x86_64 /zwtptzu\r\n==> Successfully uninstalled automake@1.15%gcc@6.2.1 arch=linux-fedora25-x86_64 /zwtptzu\r\n```\r\n@alalazo This looks like a bad rebase from #1167. Can you check to see if any of your changes caused the rest of #3690?",
