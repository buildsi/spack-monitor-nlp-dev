    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI have installed Openmpi correctly and I managed to run jobs. I need to install MPICH for another application. I install MPICH with:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n spack install mpich pmi=pmi slurm=True\r\n```\r\nThe installation is successful, however, when I run a job with srun -N 4 in the simplest case for hello world, it results in:\r\n\r\nI am 0 of 1, on host ip-172-31-52-167\r\nI am 0 of 1, on host ip-172-31-49-194\r\nI am 0 of 1, on host ip-172-31-56-170\r\nI am 0 of 1, on host ip-172-31-52-220\r\n\r\ninstead of the following wtih openmpi\r\n\r\nI am 2 of 4, on host ip-172-31-52-167\r\nI am 1 of 4, on host ip-172-31-49-194\r\nI am 0 of 4, on host ip-172-31-56-170\r\nI am 3 of 4, on host ip-172-31-52-220\r\n\r\nMy packages.yaml looks like this:\r\n\r\npackages:\r\n  slurm:\r\n    paths:\r\n      slurm@16.05.3: /opt/slurm/\r\n    buildable: False\r\n\r\nKind regards,\r\nTamara\r\n\r\n\r\n",
