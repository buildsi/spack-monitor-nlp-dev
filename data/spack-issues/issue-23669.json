    "body": "This is the start of work to try and support creating an environment, and specifying that you want to create a copy for the view instead of link. Mostly everything seems to install, e.g.,\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack env create myenv ../snakemake/tutorial/envs/spack-calling.yml \r\neval `spack env activate --sh   myenv`\r\nspack install\r\n```\r\n\r\nand most of it works, up until I hit this issue.\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n==> bcftools: Successfully installed bcftools-1.12-5mzc5eky4x4ar3u5wlrrhypvnqxqbzkw\r\n  Fetch: 0.03s.

This is the first time I'm interacting with environments and I'm doing it to have an ability to archive them with snakemake, this PR under development https://github.com/snakemake/snakemake/pull/998.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
