    "body": "Several projects have not yet added modern CMake support. This package\r\nadds find_package support for some of these projects.\r\n\r\nThe spack module in this pull request is pretty much empty. The actual guts of the project are in the github project referenced in the package, i.e., git@github.com:tuxfan/cmake-extra-modules.git. I'm hoping that we can get this into spack so that several projects can share these. In a perfect world, cmake would support these directly, or we would contribute them. However, even if this were so, it would still require that projects update to a new cmake release. The scripts in this project should work with any cmake version after 3.12.\r\n\r\n",
