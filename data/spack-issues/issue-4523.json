    "body": "Fixes issue introduced by #4230.\r\n\r\n- previous code called `which` on $EDITOR, but that doesn't work for\r\n  EDITORs like `emacs -nw` or `emacsclient -t -nw`.\r\n\r\n- This patch just trusts EDITOR if it is set (same as previous\r\n  behavior), and only uses the defaults if it's not.\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart ",
