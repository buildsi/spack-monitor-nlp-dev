    "body": "Hi,\r\n\r\nI would like to present spack as part of a talk at this year's [Datenspuren](http://datenspuren.de/) conference in Dresden, Germany.\r\n\r\nDatenspuren is a small open conference organized by a local [hackerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hackerspace) and focused on privacy, open software/hardware development and general nerd-ism. As with my minor contributions for [travis](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/5133) and [docker](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/4480), I think this is a great opportunity for outreach and would like to present/advertize the usefulness of spack, comparing it to orthogonal solutions we used previously in our software stack and why, when and where it is useful and how we (I) use it already and in the future. The talk will likely contain a lot of introduction to general concepts of FOSS distribution/packaging and is not solely focused on spack.\r\n\r\nI will create and publish slides in English, although the talks are most of the time held German (and recorded and published under CC licenses as well).\r\n\r\nQuick questions:\r\n- Is it of if I present a talk *about (using)* spack there? The talk will likely be held from me as a private person, but I need to cross check with my employer/lab.\r\n- I would lend a slide or two from the materials from your SC16 tutorials if that is ok. As usual, I would highlight the persons and institutions that do the actual work on spack (not me, I am just cheering from the side lines). Are the institute slides still up to date or did more join? I think e.g. CERN is not yet in the list and contributed recently?\r\n- Can I use the logo?\r\n- Any comments?",
