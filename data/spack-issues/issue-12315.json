    "body": "Spack stacks drop invalid dependencies applied to packages by a spec_list matrix operation\r\n\r\nWithout this fix, Spack would raise an error if orthogonal dependency constraints and non-dependency constraints were applied to the same package by a matrix and the dependency constraint was invalid for that package. This is an error, fixed by this PR.\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack:\r\n  definitions:\r\n  - packages: [libelf, hdf5+mpi]\r\n  - compilers: ['%gcc']\r\n  - mpis: [^openmpi]\r\n\r\n  specs:\r\n  - matrix:\r\n    - $packages\r\n    - $compilers\r\n    - $mpis\r\n```",
