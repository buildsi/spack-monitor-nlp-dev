    "body": "According to https://www.open-mpi.org/faq/?category=buildcuda, OpenMPI could be made CUDA-aware by using UCX built with `gdrcopy` and `CUDA`.\r\n\r\nAlthough ucx is able to detect the existence of CUDA and gdrcopy when configuring, I believe an explicit flag would be more informative.\r\n\r\nBTW it there a way to express that when `cuda_aware` is enabled, `fabrics` must be `ucx`? The current implementation is ugly for I have to include all other fabrics in `conflicts` section explicitly.",
