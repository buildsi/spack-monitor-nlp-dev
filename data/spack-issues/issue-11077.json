    "body": "This is my first contribution (thanks in advance for helping me learn the codebase so I can contribute more!) to add installation of the squashfs tools package in order to prepare for the Singularity upgrade.\r\n\r\n - I chose 4.3 as the default, the latest version\r\n - I didn't go earlier than 4.0 because it was like, back in 2009! :O \r\n - the library only requires a make and make install, so I chose `MakefilePackage` as the base class (I found the package.py file in the main source folder) and then set the prefix to the prefix variable, which I figured out was provided in the function, and the makefile expected INSTALL_DIR to be set to the prefix.\r\n - to change directory, I found other examples `with working_dir` and that seemed to do the trick!\r\n\r\nLet me know what needs to be changed / improved, etc., and glad to do it! I'll have a few more of these after this one, and hopefully learn a little more each time.",
