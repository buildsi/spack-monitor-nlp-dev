    "body": "Resources can be deleted from the local cache because `ResourceStage` moves its resources to the root stage instead of copying them. If a locally cached resource exists, it is symlinked into the resource stage and then moved out of the local cache. This can be reproduced with the following commands:\r\n1. `spack stage sqlite+functions` (fetches archive and resource)\r\n2. `spack clean`\r\n3. `spack stage sqlite+functions` (uses locally cached versions)\r\n4. `spack clean`\r\n5. `spack stage sqlite+functions` (fetches resource again)",
