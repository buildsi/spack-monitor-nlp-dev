    "body": "I don't think libpciaccess can be built with PGI compilers. The only way I was able to build OpenMPI was to trick Spack into thinking I installed libpciaccess as was done for Darwin in #257. If anyone can figure out how to build libpciaccess with PGI I will be more than happy to close this PR.\n\nSee https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spack/JX2hsOyXSdk for the relevant discussion. Thanks to @eschnett for the suggestion.\n",
