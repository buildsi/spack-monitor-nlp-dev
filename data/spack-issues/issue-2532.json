    "body": "I think it would be good to add _maintainers_ (in a very relaxed sense) -- a list of github users who are recommended to be pinged when the package is modified.\r\n\r\nSomething like\r\n```\r\nmaintainers = @john, @paul, @george, @ringo\r\n```\r\nwhich is also to be printed in `spack info`. \r\n\r\nThose maintainers could be individuals who: \r\n\r\n- are (co-)authors of the software and are using Spack\r\n- added the `package.py` to Spack \r\n- sysadmins who use this specific package and are interested in keeping it stable for their HPC users\r\n- ...\r\n\r\nThe main point is NOT to say that _maintainers_ are responsible for a given package, but instead to simplify getting feedback on PRs/issues.\r\n\r\nGiven the rapid growth of Spack package base, it will be harder and harder to remember who is interested in what package and if something is wrong, whom should one ask for a feedback.\r\n",
