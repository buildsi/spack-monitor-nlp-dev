    "body": "### Problem\r\n`spack install gcc@11.2.0` fails on Alpine Linux when building gcc's `libsanitizer` (which cannot be disabled via `./configure`). This patch fixes that.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Add two patches to `gcc@11:` to make it build successfully on Alpine.\r\n    - Ensure those patches are enabled only on Alpine by modifying the `patch()` method.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\nThis command succeeds on my Alpine install:\r\n```bash\r\n$ spack install 'gcc@11.2.0 languages=c,c++,fortran,jit'\r\n```",
