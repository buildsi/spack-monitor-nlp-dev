    "body": "`pgcc -V` was failing on `ppc64` machines because it returns 2 (despite correctly printing version information).  On `x86_64` machines the same command returns 0 and doesn't cause an error.\r\n\r\n- [x] Ignore return value of 2 for `pgcc` when doing a version check, so that the version check works on `power9`\r\n- [x] relax the version check for custom compilers introduced in #13222 so that we fall back on the verbatim compiler version if the version check fails.\r\n\r\n@becker33 @alalazo FYI",
