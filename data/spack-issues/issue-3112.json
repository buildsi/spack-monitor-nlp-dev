This is a key selling point for people advocating for Spack within their institutions: if site managers believe that Spack could introduce vulnerabilities to their system, they will not allow it.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately... in spite of all the work that's point into checksums... in the current version of Spack it can all be defeated simply by adding a package with no checksummable version (and getting users to install it).  This booby-trap is a serious problem, and cuts against the message we want to project, that Spack is safe.\r\n\r\nUntil we have a better security system in place, our best defense against this problem is to require that all packages have at least one checksummable release.\r\n\r\nEven *with* a better security system, it will still be advisable to have at least one checksummable release in every package --- because Spack won't be able to install the package without it, unless users turn off the security measures (which they shouldn't).",
