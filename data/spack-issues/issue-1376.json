    "body": "This PR provides a platform to generically cover all Cray systems is introduced to avoid having\nspecific platforms for each of XK (XE, XT), XC, and future systems using CrayPE\nand CNL.\n\nThe platform searches for 'front_end' and 'back_end' targets, in order, from:\n- Environment variables 'SPACK_FRONT_END' and 'SPACK_BACK_END'\n- A spack configuration file 'targets.yaml'\n- Parsing `/etc/bash.bashrc.local` for first loaded CrayPE CPU target.\n\nIf a back_end target is not found through one of these methods, an exception is\nraised. Otherwise, the back_end is set as the default target. The shell init\nscript search is based on recommendations in Crayports case #144359.\n\nExistence of a `targets.yaml` configuration file is optional and only eases identifying a cray front_end target.\n\nNo automagic way of determining front_end targets has been found (to date) so if\na front_end is not specified through configuration, it is ignored which should\nleave a spack instance in a consistent state.\n",
