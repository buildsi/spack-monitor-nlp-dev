    "body": "I've been meaning to do this for a very long time.\r\n\r\nPyPI recently (last year) changed its download URLs so that they include a hash in them. For example:\r\nhttps://pypi.python.org/packages/c0/3a/40967d9f5675fbb097ffec170f59c2ba19fc96373e73ad47c2cae9a30aed/numpy-1.13.1.zip#md5=2c3c0f4edf720c3a7b525dacc825b9ae\r\n\r\nThis has the consequence that you can no longer guess the URL for a particular version based on the version number alone. pypi.io seems to be a service designed to mimic the behavior of the old pypi.python.org URLs. This allows us to use nicely formatted URLs like:\r\nhttps://pypi.io/packages/source/n/numpy/numpy-1.13.1.zip\r\n\r\nThis PR converts every package that previously downloaded from pypi.python.org to pypi.io.",
