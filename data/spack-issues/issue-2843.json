    "body": "This PR implements @citibeth's idea from #1108 to change the UI for `spack create` from:\r\n```\r\n$ spack create --name <name> <url>\r\n```\r\nto:\r\n```\r\n$ spack create --url <url> <name>\r\n```\r\nI decided to separate this change from #2707 because it was a fairly controversial change. Yes, the UI now becomes more consistent with other commands in Spack (`spack subcommand packagename`), but for 99% of packages that I've created, I've only needed to specify the URL. Honestly, I'm not even sure if I like this change, but, well, here it is. I'll let @citibeth state her case as to whether or not this change should be merged.",
