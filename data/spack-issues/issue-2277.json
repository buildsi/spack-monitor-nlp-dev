    "body": "subj.\r\n\r\nFrom the current [example of the XML file](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/2112#issuecomment-255980429), it looks like we don't log whether or not `--run-tests` were executed. I think it is a must-have information as there is a big difference between someone just installing things or at least also running some quick tests, if provided by a package.\r\n\r\nIn reference to https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/2014.\r\n\r\n@tgamblin @alalazo : what do you think?\r\n\r\n",
