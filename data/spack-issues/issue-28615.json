    "body": "This commit makes changes to UMPIRE and UMap packages. \r\nUMPIRE package changes:\r\n1. Allows user to specify dependency on UMap. When +umap dependency is used, it builds a placeholder UMap branch, which will be merged into UMap's develop branch soon. \r\n2. Pulls UMPIRE feature branch (feature/integrate_umap) that builds with an installation of UMap. Ideally this will also get merged with UMPIRE's develop branch. \r\nNote: Since, UMap is an alternative to mmap, it is useful when file resources are used by UMPIRE. Hence, along with enabling UMPIRE_ENABLE_UMAP compilation flag, it also enables UMPIRE_ENABLE_FILE_RESOURCE flag.\r\n\r\nUmap package change:\r\nAs stated above, once zero_map_file branch gets merged with the UMap's develop branch, this change won't be needed.",
