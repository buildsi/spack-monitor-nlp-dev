Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n#22115 added `openssh` as a dependency to the `openmpi` package.  `openssh` fails to build on my system, which breaks multiple upstream packages that depend on `openmpi`.  \r\n\r\nThe workaround is to use an external ssh.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install openssh\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue likely only appears if the user database is managed by NIS.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOpenSSH builds successfully, but during install runs `ssh-keygen -A`.  That fails with:\r\n\r\n```\r\nNo user exists for uid 1175\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe offending code is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n     pw = getpwuid(getuid());\r\n     if (!pw)\r\n         fatal(\"No user exists for uid %lu\", (u_long)getuid());\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe root cause appears to be that `ssh-keygen` is using `libcrypto.so` from the `openssl` package via RPATH, but NIS wants the system `libcrypto.so`.  \r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ldd ssh-keygen\r\n...\r\n\tlibcrypto.so.1.1 => /home/smcmillan/git/smcmillan/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos8-haswell/gcc-8.3.1/openssl-1.1.1k-5kyfnh3x5k6hxkttqgcsysaw5ayeykoh/lib/libcrypto.so.1.1 (0x00007f34b6371000)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf I modify the `ssh-keygen` binary with `chrpath` to remove that RPATH entry, then it uses the system `libcrypto.so` and  succeeds.  This looks identical to https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1877730.  ",
