    "body": "This updates the ESMF package to version 7.1.0r and changes the url to the public-facing versions.\r\n\r\nThe previous version of ESMF wouldn't build with newer Intel compilers due to the openMP flag changing from \"-openmp\" to \"-qopenmp\". The new version (7.1.0r) now contains new build scripts to account for this change. When testing on my local mac, I also found that a new gcc patch for mac's needs to be added as well which I've included.",
