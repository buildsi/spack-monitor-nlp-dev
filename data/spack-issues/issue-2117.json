    "body": "I tried to investigate what caused the difference between `spack setup` before and after #1186 reported by @pramodk in one of the last comments of the PR. It turned out that a part of the behavior was missing in #1186 (build dependencies and install the package in the DB). This PR should fix the issue.\n\nTested on `gromacs~mpi`\n",
