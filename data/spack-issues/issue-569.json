    "body": "As discussed on the mailing list here:\n\nhttps://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spack/VR6TNzk_N9E\n\nSpack does not pick up Homebrew gcc compilers, and a further personal test also showed it doesn't find multiple installs of gcc compilers on a Linux box (i.e. `/usr/bin/gcc`, `/usr/bin/gcc-4.7`, `/usr/bin/gcc-4.9`).\n\nI think I've traced this to the suffixes used in the `gcc.py` module which only used a regex for MacPorts installs. The PR adds two additional regexes for installs of gcc that use `-MAJOR.MINOR` and `-MAJOR` suffixes. The latter is needed for Homebrew gcc5. \n\nI've only tested on a Mac with Homebrew in the `PATH` and on my Linux box with multi-gcc in `/usr/bin`, so may well need some tweaking.\n",
