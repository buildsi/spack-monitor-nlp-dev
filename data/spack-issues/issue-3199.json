Apparently, this version of git does not support queries like:\r\n```\r\n$ git diff '*.py'\r\n```\r\nmeaning that `spack flake8` always results in:\r\n```\r\n$ spack flake8\r\n=======================================================\r\nflake8: running flake8 code checks on spack.\r\n\r\nModified files:\r\n=======================================================\r\n\r\nFlake8 checks were clean.\r\n```\r\nno matter how many files are modified. We should remove the `'*.py'` constraint and do the filetype filtering by ourselves.",
