    "body": "This is my first pull request, yay! Let me know if I did anything wrong; I'm very new to Git. I wasn't sure if I should set the destination branch as develop or somehow create a new feature branch.\n\nAnyway, this is a package for SZip, a compression utility that HDF can optionally be built with. As far as I know, there's only one version available, and it's on the HDF website.\n",
