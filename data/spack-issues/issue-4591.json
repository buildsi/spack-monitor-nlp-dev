    "body": "Previously, the following prefix attributes worked great:\r\n\r\n* `prefix.bin`\r\n* `prefix.lib`\r\n\r\nbut as soon as you needed something new, you were S.O.L.:\r\n\r\n* `prefix.examples`\r\n* `prefix.bin.perl`\r\n\r\nThis led to several PRs adding new attributes to the `Prefix` class:\r\n\r\n* #4321 added `prefix.include64`\r\n* #3905 added `prefix.bin64`\r\n* 295ffd8c506821ed079d2151fb21cd27979d7387 added `prefix.share_man[1-8]`\r\n\r\nThis is cumbersome, and more often than not leads to people using `join_path(prefix, 'examples')`. I've never been a big fan of `join_path`. It's just plain ugly...\r\n\r\nWith this PR, these limitations have been removed. Now, any prefix attribute you can think of works:\r\n\r\n* `prefix.foo.bar.baz == $prefix/foo/bar/baz`\r\n\r\nAll prefix attributes are defined on the fly, so they don't need to be declared beforehand. This means that most of the uses of `join_path` are now obsolete. I won't remove all uses of `join_path` in this PR, but we should encourage users to do this from now on.",
