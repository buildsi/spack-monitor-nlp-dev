    "body": "This builds on #10192 and should be merged after it.\r\n\r\n`parse_anonymous_spec()` is a vestige of the days when Spack didn't support nameless specs well.  We don't need it anymore because now we can write `Spec()` for a spec that will match anything, and `satisfies()` semantics work properly for anonymous specs.\r\n\r\n- [x] Delete `parse_anonymous_spec()` and replace its uses with simple calls to the Spec() constructor.\r\n- [x] make then handling of when='...' specs in directives more consistent.\r\n- [x] clean up Spec.__contains__()\r\n- [x] refactor directives and tests slightly to accommodate the change.",
