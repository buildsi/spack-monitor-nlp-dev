    "body": "The changes in this pull request modify the `qt` package in the following ways:\r\n\r\n- Add support for `@5.12.7`, which requires the new `qt5-12-configure` patch.\r\n- Add the `+debug` variant to allow for the export of debugging symbols.\r\n- Modify the `+opengl` variant to require any version of the `gl` package instead of only `gl@3.2:`.\r\n\r\nI've verified that the `qt@5.12.7{+/~}debug+opengl ^gl@1.4` variants work in the `gcc%4.9.3 arch=linux-rhel7-broadwell` build environment. In terms of more complete testing, I'm fairly confident that `+debug` variant will work for `qt@4` since I was using it in a local branch some time ago, but I'm unsure whether or not it will work for `qt@3`; I can test that version as well if needed.",
