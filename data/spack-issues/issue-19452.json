This exercise uncovered issues with the NVIDIA compilers that will be fixed in future versions.  When those fixes are available, some of these changes can be modified to be conditional on the `nvhpc` version.\r\n\r\nThe default version of the `numactl` package was bumped to the latest release.\r\n\r\ncc @scheibelp ",
