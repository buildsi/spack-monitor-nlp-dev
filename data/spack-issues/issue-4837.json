    "body": "If you edit a package like `zlib` to add a fake mulit-valued variant:\r\n```python\r\nvariant('foo', default='bar', values=('a', 'b', 'c'))\r\n```\r\nthere is no logic in place to make sure that `default` is a member of `values`. Spack installs `zlib foo=bar` just fine. @alalazo Is this expected or is it a bug?",
