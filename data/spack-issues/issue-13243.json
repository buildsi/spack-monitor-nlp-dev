    "body": "Satisfaction checks on dependencies should be strict when the parent check is strict\r\n\r\nThis is intended for constraints like \r\n\r\n```\r\ndepends_on('py-backports-functools-lru-cache', when='^python@:2')\r\n```\r\n\r\ncurrently, Spack will add the `py-backports-functools-lru-cache` dependency at a point in the concretization when the dependency is just `^python` (without a version) because strict constraint checking does not propagate to dependency constraint checking.\r\n\r\nNote that because the concretizer is greedy, the constraints applied by the `py-backports-functools-lru-cache` dependency will be applied later and may generate concretizer conflicts (which requires the user to specify certain constraints on the command line), but this avoids the concretizer incorrectly adding the `py-backports-functools-lru-cache` dependency. \r\n\r\nAn example package this fixes is `py-soupsieve`.",
