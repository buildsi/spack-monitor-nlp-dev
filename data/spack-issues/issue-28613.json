Or so it seems until `ascent +fortran` tries to configure when all of the sudden it can't find the conduit.mod file.\r\n\r\nI went digging around and finally found the culprit, the listed projects _silently_ hide turning off fortran when it is requested, even if there is a valid fortran compiler available. Either `self.compiler.fc` is not set for some reason or `SPACK_FC` is not set in the hostconfig stage context reliably (it is in the `spack-build-env.txt` file for what it is worth). Just removing all of the f_compiler logic fixes this issue, but my sense around these projects is they have some reason for doing all of these things.\r\n\r\nThis will always fail to build whatever project _downstream_ needs `conduit +fortran` but never fail to build a `conduit +fortran`. This is really not ideal, if a spec is specified the package should build to that spec or not build at all.\r\n\r\nhostconfig:\r\n[perlmutter-ascent-host-config.cmake.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7942267/perlmutter-ascent-host-config.cmake.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nOn Perlmutter\r\n[perlmutter-ascent-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7942904/perlmutter-ascent-build-out.txt)\r\n[perlmutter-ascent-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7942905/perlmutter-ascent-build-env.txt)\r\n\r\n```\r\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-823-28565749ff\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.13\r\n* **Platform:** cray-sles15-zen3\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nMy environment is setup using the [spack-confg for perlmutter](https://github.com/spack/spack-configs/tree/main/NERSC/perlmutter/e4s-21.11/site_config) with some minor modifications around nvidia/cuda stuff which should affect this at all.
