    "body": "Versions 2.7.1--2.7.3 fix one of two vulnerabilities.\n\nThe only version of git known to be completely non-vulnerable is 2.8, which is not yet released.  This package will now install 2.8.0-rc2 by default --- assuming that a RC version is better than one known to be vulnerable.\n\nThere is currently no tarball download for v2.8.0-rc2.  Instead, it is downloaded directly from GitHub.  Additional autoconf dependency was added to create the ./configure script, which is normally only available in distributed tarballs.  The added dependency is no problem for Spack.\n",
