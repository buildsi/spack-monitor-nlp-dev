    "body": "I am trying to build GCC 5.4.0 with spack. It has a variant languages:\r\n\r\n```\r\n    languages [all]    all, ada, brig, c,      Compilers and runtime libraries to\r\n                       c++, fortran, go,       build\r\n                       java, jit, lto,         \r\n                       objc, obj-c++         \r\n```\r\n\r\nThe packages.py file contains the following statement:\r\n\r\n    depends_on('gnat', when='languages=ada')\r\n\r\nWhen trying to build it with languages=all, I would expect that it keeps the dependency on gnat, since all should include ada:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack install gcc@5.4.0+binutils~piclibs languages=all ^binutils@2.28 ^gmp@6.1.2 ^gnat@2016 ^isl@0.18 ^mpc@1.0.3 ^mpfr@3.1.5 ^zip@3.0 ^zlib@1.2.11 %gcc@4.8.5 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n==> Error: gcc does not depend on gnat or zip\r\n```\r\n\r\nHow would the syntax in the packages.py file need to be changed such that it keeps the dependency if languages is ada or all ?\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\n",
