    "body": "Hello,\r\nI try to use Spack on the SuperMUC HPC system. Unfortunately, the systems blocks outgoing internet connection. How can I use spack in such an environment?\r\n\r\nMy idea would be create a list of packages to be downloaded, do the download on another machine and then compile the packages. However, I found nothing about that on the documentation or on the internet.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
