    "body": "This is the same as https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/7843 but with factored commits. The attribution is incorrect on them (I need to use https://help.github.com/articles/creating-a-commit-with-multiple-authors/ to add @citibeth as a coauthor on most of these).\r\n\r\n@tgamblin ready for review. In short this PR:\r\n\r\n* Adds the `spack env` command: This maintains an environment object which tracks a set of specs, a spack configuration, and a repository. The user \r\n  * Adds documentation which explains the usage of this command\r\n  * Adds unit tests\r\n  * Renames the old `spack env` command to `spack build-env`\r\n* Refactors several common arguments in Spack commands so that e.g. `spack install` command options apply to `spack env foo install`\r\n* Addresses some issues with `Spec.to_node_dict` to preserve patches/concreteness, so that a spec is concrete & complete after converting to/from JSON\r\n\r\nUnfortunately since this replaces the `cmd/env.py` file, the github diff presents this as if I had edited the file from it's original state (vs. actually I renamed `env.py` and started from scratch). That is to say: it would be easier to just read `cmd/env.py` in an editor since all of its content is new.",
