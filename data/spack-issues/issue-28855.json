    "body": "This PR is stacked on top of #28854 and #28853.\r\n\r\nUpdate neovim to use luajit-openresty by default, also clean up some issues that currently force the package to use regular lua.  This currently does not produce a working neovim on mac, it builds successfully but runs into an allocator issue from luajit that's specific to catalina and higher, but it does build a working configuration on linux.",
