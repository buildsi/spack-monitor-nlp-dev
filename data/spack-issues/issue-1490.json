    "body": "Let's say you're writing a package and only a single version needs to be patched. If you try to define a patch as follows:\n\n``` python\n@when('@1.2.2')\ndef patch(self):\n   ....\n```\n\nthen `spack patch package@1.2.2` works fine. But `spack patch package@1.2.4` crashes with the following error message:\n\n```\n==> patch() function failed for py-pyside\n==> Error: Package PyPyside does not support patch called with py-pyside@1.2.2.  Options are: py-pyside@1.2.2\n```\n",
