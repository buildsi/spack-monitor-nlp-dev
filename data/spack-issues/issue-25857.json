    "body": "This PR ensures an exception is raised if at least one failure is detected in the stand-alone tests of a test suite. \r\n\r\nIt has been tested at the command line to confirm a non-zero exit status is returned after printing the following error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Error: <#> test(s) in the suite failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhere `<#>` is the number of tests in the suite that failed.\r\n\r\nAs indicated in `spack test run --help`, you can use the following options to terminate the test suite early:\r\n- `--fail-first` = stop testing and report the error after detecting the first package test failure (one failure per package);\r\n- `--fail-fast` = stop testing and report the error after detecting the first test failure (one failing package per test suite).",
