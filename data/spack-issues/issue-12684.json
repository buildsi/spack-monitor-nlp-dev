    "body": "I'm getting the same warning message, for which I may have found the root cause, even if the problem may be slightly different.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nI get a warning when I do `spack spec llvm@8.0.0`, which requires python. For the latter one, I changed `packages.yaml` to use a module provided by the system.\r\n\r\nThe interesting line inside the python module is\r\n```console\r\nprepend-path    LD_LIBRARY_PATH    /opt/cray/pe/gcc-libs\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n```console\r\n==> Warning: Extracted path from module does not exist:\r\n\tExtracted path: /opt/cray/pe/gcc-lib\r\n```\r\n\r\n***The problem, in my case, is that the last character gets truncated.***\r\n\r\nI saw that #12662, but I think that the issue is slightly different, even if the problem may reside in the same code portion.",
