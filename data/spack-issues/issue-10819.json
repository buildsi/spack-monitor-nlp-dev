    "body": "This PR adds `libimobiledevice, needed for iOS interaction from various Unix systems.\r\n\r\nThere's a small catch with this PR that I'm not sure what to do with; the `1.2.0` version (latest) requires `SSLv3` which we don't have variants for in `openssl`. As this is deprecated by the IETF, I don't want to add that variant.\r\n\r\nAs such, should I simply remove the `1.2.0` version from this package for now, or leave it so that people can link OpenSSL manually?
