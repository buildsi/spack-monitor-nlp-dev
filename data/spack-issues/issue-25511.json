    "body": "From the Melissa README:\r\n\r\n> Melissa is a file avoiding, fault tolerant and elastic framework, to run large scale sensitivity analysis on supercomputers. Largest runs so far involved up to 30k core, executed 80 000 parallel simulations, and generated 288 TB of intermediate data that did not need to be stored on the file system.\r\n> \r\n> Classical sensitivity analysis consists in running different instances of the simulation with different set of input parameters, store the results to disk to later read them back from disk to compute the required statistics. The amount of storage needed can quickly become overwhelming, with the associated long read time that makes statistic computing time consuming. To avoid this pitfall, scientists reduce their study size by running low resolution simulations or down-sampling output data in space and time.\r\n> \r\n> Melissa bypasses this limitation by avoiding intermediate file storage. Melissa processes the data online (in transit) enabling very large scale sensitivity analysis. Melissa is built around two key concepts: iterative (sometimes also called incremental) statistics algorithms and asynchronous client/server model for data transfer. Simulation outputs are never stored on disc. They are sent by the simulations to a parallel server, which aggregate them to the statistic fields in an iterative fashion, and then throw them away. This allows to compute oblivious statistics maps on every mesh element for every time step on a full scale study.",
