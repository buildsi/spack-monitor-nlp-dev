    "body": "One of the things that I like about Spack is that it allows users to upgrade existing software stacks on different supercomputers with minimal help from system administrators. For example, a scientist got access (and computational resources) to a supercomputer (e.g one of the [PRACE](http://www.prace-ri.eu/prace-resources/) machines) she hasn't worked with before. The problem she has now is to find out which software is already installed, which compilers are available, and how to install everything that is required for the numerical experiments. Spack gives answers only to the third question and partially to the second one (in generel, Spack can't detect compilers that become available via environment modules).\r\n\r\nMy suggestion is that we organize a repository (maybe a separate git repository inside Spack organization) with configurations for particular sites: packages.yaml to describe what is already installed and compilers.yaml to tell which modules to load and additional environment variables to set. Later we could probably introduce a feature, so Spack would use corresponding configurations depending on `hostname` and some additional heuristics.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think about the idea? Do you think if it's OK to make the information about installed software open?",
