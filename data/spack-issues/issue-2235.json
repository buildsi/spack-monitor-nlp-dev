    "body": "I really want a better `spack setup` command.  It would work like `spack setup --pkg <pkg1> --pkg <pkg2> ... <spec>`.  The idea is, Spack would generate a `setup.py` file for every package specified by `--pkg` while scanning the concretized spec.  This would be useful for setting up a manual build on a few packages within a large DAG.\r\n",
