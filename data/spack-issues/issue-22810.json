    "body": "<!--*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*-->\r\n\r\nAt present, calling `spack dev-build <some-spec>` when an environment is activated will correctly build the source in the current folder and install it. However it will not be added to the environment (`spack find` doesn't list it). Calling `spack add <some-spec>` beforehand doesn't solve the problem. The only way to have a dev-build in an environment is to edit the environment's YAML file.\r\n\r\nIn comparison, calling `spack install <some-spec>` from within an environment implies `spack add <some-spec>` and will install the requested package and make it a root spec.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nIt's not uncommon to create a development environment and have some of the specs be local source trees. Enabling easier dev-build within environments would be very helpful.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n`spack dev-build <some-spec>` should have a behavior similar to that of `spack install <some-spec>` within environments as well. Additionally, there shouldn't be any conflict if the user has called `spack add <some-spec>` beforehand.\r\n",
