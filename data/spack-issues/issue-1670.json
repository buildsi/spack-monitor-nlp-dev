    "body": "Attributes like `lapack_shared_lib` in `lapack` providers now return a single full path to a library.  Changing those attributes to be iterables of paths would help in dealing with libraries like `MKL` that require to link more than one library with a well defined ordering.\n\nIf there is general agreement on this change I volunteer to prepare a PR that : \n- will change all the relevant virtual packages in such way\n- will modify all the packages that are now using those attributes accordingly\n- will add a few convenience functions to handle common manipulations of those iterables \n\nLet me know :smile: \n",
