    "body": "The main problem I've found so far with `spack package-list` is that the `package.py` URL is incorrect. It was never updated after the var directory was rearranged. I've never looked through this command before, so I'll add any other bugs I discover to this issue.\n\nThis bug was discovered in #1576 by adding documentation testing. It will be fixed in #1576. This issue is being opened to track the problem.\n",
