    "body": "Allow views to specify projections more complicated than merging every package into a shared prefix. This will allow sites to configure a view for the way they want to present packages to their users.\r\n\r\n- [x] Create a yaml schema for specifying projections of packages into a view (based on spec.format strings)\r\n- [x] Formalize the schema and check for adherence\r\n- [x] Ensure that extensions work with combinatorial views\r\n- [x] Update spec.format to allow dependency information in format strings\r\n- [x] Add testing for combinatorial views\r\n- [x] Update documentation for views with options for specifying projections\r\n\r\nFrom the new documentation for views:\r\n\r\nThe default projection into a view is to link every package into the\r\nroot of the view. This can be changed through the ``projections.yaml``\r\nfile in the view. The projection configuration file for a view located\r\nat ``/my/view`` is stored in ``/my/view/.spack/projections.yaml``.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a view, the projection configuration file can also be\r\nspecified from the command line using the ``--projection-file`` option\r\nto the ``spack view`` command.\r\n\r\nThe projections configuration file is a mapping of partial specs to\r\nspec format strings, as shown in the example below.\r\n\r\n```\r\nprojections:\r\n    zlib: ${PACKAGE}-${VERSION}\r\n    ^mpi: ${PACKAGE}-${VERSION}/${DEP:mpi:PACKAGE}-${DEP:mpi:VERSION}-${COMPILERNAME}-${COMPILERVER}\r\n    all: ${PACKAGE}-${VERSION}/${COMPILERNAME}-${COMPILERVER}\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe entries in the projections configuration file must all be either\r\nspecs or the keyword ``all``. ~~For each spec, the projection used will\r\nbe the first **non-``all``** entry that the spec satisfies, or the projection for the \r\n``all`` entry if one exists and the spec satisfies no other entries ~~and the keyword ``all`` is\r\nsatisfied by any spec~~. Given the example above, any spec satisfying\r\n``zlib@1.2.8`` will be linked into ``/my/view/zlib-1.2.8/``, any spec\r\nsatisfying ``hdf5@1.8.10+mpi %gcc@4.9.3 ^mvapich2@2.2`` will be linked\r\ninto ``/my/view/hdf5-1.8.10/mvapich2-2.2-gcc-4.9.3``, and any spec\r\nsatisfying ``hdf5@1.8.10~mpi %gcc@4.9.3`` will be linked into\r\n``/my/view/hdf5-1.8.10/gcc-4.9.3``.\r\n\r\nIf the keyword ``all`` does not appear in the projections\r\nconfiguration file, any spec that does not satisfy any entry in the\r\nfile will be linked into the root of the view as in a single-prefix\r\nview. ~~Any entries that appear below the keyword ``all`` in the\r\nprojections configuration file will not be used, as all specs will use\r\nthe projection under ``all`` before reaching those entries.~~",
