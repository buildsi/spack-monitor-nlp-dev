    "body": "As a user I want to have microarchitecture specific flags injected for LLVM compilers so that I would compile by default code that is optimized for the target of the installation.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWe already support this feature for GCC since #3206 and need to extend the capability to other compilers as well\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nWhat needs to be done is carefully reviewing docs and man pages, and encode in [this file](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/lib/spack/llnl/util/cpu/microarchitectures.json) the information found.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nA non exhaustive list of pages we might want to consult:\r\n- Docs linked in the official [Download page](https://releases.llvm.org/download.html)\r\n\r\nWe also need to check what will be the Fortran support for clang and if `flang` is compatible with all of the `-march` flags.\r\n",
