    "body": "Fixes #3774. The previous release came with a tarball that was already configured. It wasn't possible to install the package without running `make distclean` first. The latest release doesn't suffer from this problem.\r\n\r\nI decided to rename the `libjson-c` package to `json-c`. That's what the developers seem to call it.",
