    "body": "Depends on #28786\r\n\r\nThis PR does a sweep of Bioconductor R packages in Spack, and does the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n- add new versions of packages for bioconductor 3.14\r\n- make sure the bioc attribute is set\r\n- add new packages as required\r\n\r\nDue to adding the bioc attribute, almost all R bioconductor packages had\r\nchanges. Since almost all packages were being touched, I also tried to\r\nstandardize the formatting of the packages.\r\n\r\n- make sure there is a short and long description\r\n- have dependencies specified in the same order as in the DESCRIPTION\r\n  file\r\n- place when directives at the end\r\n\r\nHaving consistency makes it easier to process these in bulk. The process\r\nis script driven but requires interaction. I am hopeful that the\r\nconsistent formatting will allow for further automation. All of the\r\npackages in this PR were built with gcc-10.3.0 prior to submitting the\r\nPR.",
