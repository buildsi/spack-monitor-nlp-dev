    "body": "Fixes #25580 \r\n\r\n@mdorier @ax3l can you test this? I'm able to successfully install on macOS 10.15.7 with Python 3.8.11 and Apple Clang 12.0.0, and all tests pass.\r\n\r\nI had to override the `build_directory` because that's where `PythonPackage` looks for a `setup.py` file. Hopefully there aren't any negative consequences of building in the source directory.\r\n\r\nWe could move the URL to `pypi` if we want to. There are a lot of benefits from directly subclassing from `PythonPackage`. When subclassing two classes like this, all attributes come from the first package if available, then the second package if not.",
