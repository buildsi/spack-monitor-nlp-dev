    "body": "This PR:\r\n\r\n- Replaces buildcache index.html with a json index\r\n- Provides a spec schema\r\n- Provides a database index schema which uses new spec schema\r\n- Provides a schema for buildcache `spec.yaml` files, which also uses new spec schema\r\n- Updates the Database class to support using it for buildcache index generation (the implementation here feels hacky, could probably use the eyes of someone familiar with the Database and how it's used)\r\n- Change `binary_distribution.py` so buildcache index generation uses Database class\r\n- Updates some tests to include validation using new schemas\r\n- Removes unused spack command now that S3 mirror work is in place",
