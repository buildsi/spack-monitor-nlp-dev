    "body": "This change adds support for building the hipblas-test client and teaches spack how to run the tests. The change is pretty similar to #26919. Though, these tests will run ~30 minutes.\r\n\r\nTo give it a spin, try:\r\n```\r\nspack install --verbose --test=root hipblas@4.3.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n@haampie @srekolam @arjun-raj-kuppala",
