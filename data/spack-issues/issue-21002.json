    "body": "Previously, Spack's local downloads cache followed the simple structure:\r\n```\r\n$spack/var/spack/cache/package/package-version.tar.gz\r\n```\r\nIf, for whatever reason, Spack/curl was unable to download a particular package, it was easy to download it with wget or on another system and drop it into the downloads cache. This was particularly useful for licensed software that had to be downloaded manually. However, now the downloads cache follows a hash-based structure:\r\n```\r\n$spack/var/spack/cache/_source-cache/archive/hash/hash.tar.gz\r\n```\r\nmaking it impossible to predict the correct path. \r\n\r\nAccording to the [Mirrors](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mirrors.html) documentation:\r\n\r\n> The cache is a valid spack mirror: it uses the same directory structure and naming scheme as other Spack mirrors\r\n\r\nHowever, this seems to no longer be the case.\r\n\r\n@becker33 @tldahlgren @scheibelp I'm guessing one of you worked on the new hash-based downloads cache scheme?",
