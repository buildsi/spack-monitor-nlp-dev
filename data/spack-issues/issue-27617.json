    "body": "### Summary\r\n\r\nI wish I could install CUDA using **sudo apt-get install cuda** instead of the run script that the current package.py for CUDA uses. I'm working on a HDF5 Virtual File Driver (VFD) for GPUDirect Storage (GDS) package. The current Spack CUDA package doesn't install GDS support because NVIDIA run script lacks it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nFrom https://docs.nvidia.com/gpudirect-storage/troubleshooting-guide/index.html#troubleshoot-install :\r\n\r\n> Make sure the NVIDIA driver is installed using the Ubuntu APT/Redhat RPM, YUM and DNF package manager. NVIDIA drivers installed using the NVIDIA-Linux-x86_64.<version>.run file are NOT supported with the nvidia-gds package.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'd like to know how to approach this problem.\r\nHere are possibilities:\r\n\r\n- Add a function that executes shell script 'sudo apt-get install cuda' to the existing CUDA package.py.\r\n- Create a new package called cuda-gds.\r\n- Wait until NVIDIA supports GDS via the run script.\r\n\r\nMy main question is, is there a Spack template for using APT package manager? It seems that Spack community wants to build everything from source code for portability and dependency resolution. \r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
