Manually remove this\n  directory to fix:\n  /ddnA/project/eschnett/shelob/src/spack/opt/spack/linux-\n  redhat6-x86_64/gcc-6.1.0-spack/julia-master-\n  65fs5pr57mv6jfcj7cqvu3ipdw4n56uo\n```\n\nInstead of asking me to manually remove the prefix, Spack should mark the prefix directory as \"incomplete\" (e.g. via a file named `THIS IS NOT A COMPLETE INSTALL\"), and should test for this file while checking whether the prefix is a valid install.\n",
