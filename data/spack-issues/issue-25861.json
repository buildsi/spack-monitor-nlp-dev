    "body": "Since reading files over the network is highly IO bound, it seems like a good candidate for multi-threading (even with the GIL).  This PR uses a threadpool to fetch spec yamls and read them, in an attempt to speed up the `spack buildcache update-index` command.  Even though much of the time in that method is spent checking and splicing the spec.yaml files on the mirror, this is fairly low-hanging fruit and could make a big difference on mirrors with a lot of spec.yaml files to fetch.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Evaluate whether the thread method is doing too much cpu work\r\n- [ ] Try to measure the speedup compared to fetching the spec.yaml files in serial",
