The lines\r\n```\r\ndepends_on('superlu-dist@6.1:6.3.0~int64', when='@3.13.0:3.13.99+superlu-dist+mpi~int64')\r\ndepends_on('superlu-dist@6.1:6.3.0+int64', when='@3.13.0:3.13.99+superlu-dist+mpi+int64')\r\n```\r\nshould be changed to something like\r\n```\r\ndepends_on('superlu-dist@6.1:6.3.0~int64', when='@3.13.0:3.14.99+superlu-dist+mpi~int64')\r\ndepends_on('superlu-dist@6.1:6.3.0+int64', when='@3.13.0:3.14.99+superlu-dist+mpi+int64')\r\n```\r\nOtherwise `spack install petsc+superlu-dist` fails to configure PETSc with SuperLU-fist.\r\n\r\n@balay \r\n\r\n",
