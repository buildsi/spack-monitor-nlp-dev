    "body": "Fixes a couple of build issues I noticed:\r\n\r\n1. libnetworkit requires OpenMP, but Apple Clang doesn't have OpenMP\r\n2. I broke the `py-networkit` package in #27798\r\n\r\nBefore #27798, we ran:\r\n```console\r\n$ python setup.py build --networkit-external-core\r\n$ python setup.py install ...\r\n```\r\nAfter #27798, we run `pip install .` which runs:\r\n```console\r\n$ python setup.py install --networkit-external-core ...\r\n```\r\nHowever, this flag is only valid for build, not for install. Removing this flag allows the build to succeed for me.\r\n\r\nP.S. I noticed a build issue on RHEL 8 where the libnetworkit build fails to find tlx and crashes, not sure what is going on there.",
