    "body": "`blaspp` has an implicit CUDA detection. The PR introduces a variant which controls whether CUDA is enabled/disabled. This is important in cases where the implicit CUDA detection logic backfires. One such case is when `cuda` is external and marked as `buildable=false`. `blaspp`'s CMake CUDA detection logic finds an external cuda installations in default directories but certain paths are not properly set which leads to build [issues][1]. The explicit cuda dependency resolves this both with `+cuda` and `-cuda`. ~~The former is the default as the CUDA detection logic always runs unless explicitly disabled.~~\r\n\r\n[1]: https://bitbucket.org/icl/blaspp/issues/6/compile-error-due-to-implicit-cuda ",
