    "body": "Add code to NetCDF to require HDF5 1.8 by default, so that the default behaviour when installing NetCDF does not change.\n\nThis moves the version requirement from HDF5 to NetCDF where it originates. (I believe the NetCDF community does not want to use HDF5 1.10 features by default because of backward compatibility.) Instead of making a choice for the default of all HDF5 package users, this patch makes this choice only for the NetCDF package.\n",
