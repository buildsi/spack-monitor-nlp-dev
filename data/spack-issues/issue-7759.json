    "body": "Makes the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Don't generate modules for external packages\r\n* Remove assertion from `Spec.path_for_spec` which checks that the path doesn't contain the spack install root: it isn't required\r\n* Check for non-existent prefixes in build_environment when collecting prefixes (e.g. if the package has a module rather than a prefix - this isn't and issue with spack-installed packages though)",
