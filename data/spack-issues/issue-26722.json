    "body": "The platform string for this Cray AMD system is `cray-sles15-zen2`, which results in a platform name starting with `cray`. There is no platform file starting with `cray`. This change maps `cray` to `linux`.\r\n\r\nThe system doesn't have any X11 libraries or include files installed in it and the current logic relied on the fact that it could find `X11/Xlib.h` and `X11/X.h` in some system location for the tests that are required for the compiling the `xcbglxintegrations` module when using configuring with `opengl`. Adding the include paths to the config options to point to the spack built versions fixes this.\r\n\r\nThese changes were tested with qt 5.14.2.",
