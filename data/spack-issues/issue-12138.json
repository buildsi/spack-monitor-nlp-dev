    "body": "Previously, we were doing string to int comparison like `(1, 3) > ('1', '2')`. This is incredibly buggy:\r\n```python\r\n$ python2\r\n>>> '10' > 9\r\nTrue\r\n>>> 10 > '9'\r\nFalse\r\n>>> '9' < 10\r\nFalse\r\n>>> 9 < '10'\r\nTrue\r\n```\r\nAlso, this does not work at all in Python 3. You get the following error message when trying to install `qt@4 platform=darwin`:\r\n```\r\n==> Error: TypeError: '>=' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'int'\r\n```\r\nThis PR makes use of the `Version` class for version comparison.",
