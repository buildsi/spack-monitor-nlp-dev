    "body": "Ftagshtml is a Fortran (and simple C) to HTML browsing, it resolves static interface overload.\r\nIt can handle some LaTeX comments inside the source files (with -hevea)\r\nIt only needs to be put somewhere into your disk since it uses Perl.\r\nIt also provides javatex2.pl initmak.pl getin.pl and view.pl :\r\n- javatex is a post-process for LaTex2HTML making a tree view,\r\n- initmak finds f90 dependencies but can also make them optional when interface is not changed to avoid recompiling all,\r\n- getin is a powerfull grep (when a variable is set/declared/changes name at calls)\r\n- view is when you have a Web server and a cgi-bin (through suExec typically)\r\n",
