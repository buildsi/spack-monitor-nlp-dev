    "body": "<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2. Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install mpfr\r\n\r\n...\r\nlibtool: Version mismatch error.  This is libtool 2.4.6, but the\r\nlibtool: definition of this LT_INIT comes from libtool 2.4.2.\r\nlibtool: You should recreate aclocal.m4 with macros from libtool 2.4.6\r\nlibtool: and run autoconf again.\r\n```\r\nI looked into the issue a little, and the `package.py` file does specify `force_autoreconf = True`, which seems to be what is needed. `aclocal` does get called, which I think should regenerate the file, but clearly that's not working.\r\n\r\nI was able to build it directly from the stage directory, but I think that was using libtool 2.4.2. \r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2-1609-5e1cb24\r\n* **Python:** 2.7.16\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-ivybridge\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/4852360/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/4852361/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
