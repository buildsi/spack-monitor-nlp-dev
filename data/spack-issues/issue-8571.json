    "body": "See: https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/5015\r\n\r\nThe documentation in the linked PR recommends using the following when setting CC for a \"make\" invocation:\r\n\r\n> If the Makefile ignores environment variables, the next thing to try is command-line arguments. You can do this by overriding the build_targets attribute.\r\n> `build_targets = ['CC=cc']`\r\n\r\nThis is a hack: there should be a way to specify additional arguments that should be passed to make/make install.\r\n\r\nThere is a non-hack approach which is more manual: you can override the `install` method in the package which inherits from `MakefilePackage` and supply the CC setting as an argument (in which case you have to be careful to add the build/install targets yourself).",
