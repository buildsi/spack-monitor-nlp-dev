    "body": "I would like to have separate spack installations to hold packages for different processor architectures (which are on different machines) but where both processors use the same network file share . I know it is supposed to be possible for them to share one spack installation but one system (an aarch54) is a bit slow and has corrupted the installation a couple of times. \r\n\r\nI have tried cloning spack into a different directory (\"armspack\") but it spack on first opertation creates the auxiliary directory \".spack\". My other installation (for Intel processors) would also want to use \".spack\". Can I in fact control the name of this auxiliary directory? I cannot find a setting for it.\r\n",
