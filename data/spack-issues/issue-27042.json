    "body": "Generalize the `fftw` dependency on the `fftw-api` virtual package (aka Spack Provider). That way, we can use the FFTW API from Cray's `libsci`, MKL and others.\r\n\r\nI don't like that I cannot control the `+mpi`/`~mpi` requirement as well as `+openmp`/`~openmp` anymore for those from our `depends_on()` calls, but what shall I do.\r\n\r\nCurrently Spack concretizes `depends_on('fftw-api ~mpi +openmp')` to `^fftw@3.3.10+mpi~openmp`.\r\n\r\nUpdate: using `when='^fftw'` dependencies now for `fftw` variants.\r\n\r\n\r\n- [x] rebase after #27043\r\n- [ ] depends on a solution/work-around/workflow for https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/1712",
