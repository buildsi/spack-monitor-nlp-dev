    "body": "A recursive uninstall (spack uninstall -r) would seem to be in order.  This might uninstall a lot of stuff, of course.  Dangerous but useful.  Especially when you've installed package A and it caused package C to be installed, and you realized C was installed with the wrong parameters.\n\nMaybe have it ask for confirmation by default, unless you add another magic flag (-q? -f?) to tell it to not ask for confirmation.\n",
