    "body": "This adds the H5Z-ZFP filter plugin package\r\n\r\nI adjusted zfp package variant to accept 4 choices for bsws variant controlling the bit stream word size instead of just setting uint8.\r\n\r\nThe H5Z-ZFP plugin really needs `depends_on('zfp bsws=8')` but that appears to be failing in spack internally somewhere...\r\n\r\n```\r\n[scratlantis:~/spack/spack] miller86% spack install h5z-zfp\r\n==> Error: Invalid spec: 'zfp@0.5.1%clang@7.3.0-apple bsws=8 arch=darwin-elcapitan-x86_64'. Package zfp requires variant bsws=8, but spec asked for bsws=8\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, I will fix after I can file a bug ticket for this.",
