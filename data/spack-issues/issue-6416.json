    "body": "-d, --docs option will edit doc files.\r\n\r\nAlso improves edit command suffix extrapolation for core files. Previously assumed all files are '*.py', which doesn't work or docs. Now checks filesystem for all files of that name, and will die gracefully if != 1.\r\n\r\nYou can also now specify a full name including suffix for internal files. \r\n\r\nNo change in behavior for package files.",
