    "body": "`PMIx` support (via variant) was added to this OpenMPI spackage in commit 98466f9b120, 2021-10-01; looks like `PMIx` has been present within the project since `openmpi@2`.  A dependency on `libevent` was listed in that commit, however it is only effectively applied to `openmpi@4:`  This MR fixes up the OpenMPI versions in between.  If this MR is _not_ applied, the build fails like this, e.g., when I attempt to build `openmpi@3.1.6`:\r\n\r\n> 1 error found in build log:\r\n>      1765    --- MCA component pmix:ext2x (m4 configuration macro)\r\n>      1766    checking for MCA component pmix:ext2x compile mode... static\r\n>      1767    checking if external component is version 2.x... yes\r\n>      1768    configure: WARNING: EXTERNAL PMIX SUPPORT REQUIRES USE OF EXTERNAL LIBEVENT\r\n>      1769    configure: WARNING: LIBRARY. THIS LIBRARY MUST POINT TO THE SAME ONE USED\r\n>      1770    configure: WARNING: TO BUILD PMIX OR ELSE UNPREDICTABLE BEHAVIOR MAY RESULT\r\n>      1771    configure: error: PLEASE CORRECT THE CONFIGURE COMMAND LINE AND REBUILD\r\n\r\nThis occurs because `libevent` is a direct spack dependency of `pmix` whereas this version _hole_ in the OpenMPI spackage permits its configuration to pick up the system `libevent`, thereby crashing the configure due to version skew.",
