    "body": "Fixes #5114.\r\n\r\nOn Cray platforms, we rely heavily on the module system to figure out what targets, compilers, etc. are available. This unfortunately means that we shell out to the `module` command as part of platform initialization.\r\n\r\nBecause we run subcommands in a shell, we can get infinite recursion if `setup-env.sh` and friends are in some init script like `.bashrc`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the infinite loop by adding guards around `setup-env.sh`, `setup-env.csh`, and `setup-env.fish`, to prevent recursive initializations of Spack. This is safe because Spack never shells out to itself, so we do not need it to be initialized in subshells.\r\n\r\n- [x] add recursion guard around `setup-env.sh`\r\n- [x] add recursion guard around `setup-env.csh`\r\n- [x] add recursion guard around `setup-env.fish`",
