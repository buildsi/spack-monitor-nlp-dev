    "body": "Magma is not currently compatible with CUDA-11. While this is reflected\r\nin the package, it is done with a comment in a `depends_on` directive,\r\nwhich has the effect of trying to install a version of CUDA that may be\r\ndifferent from the one in the current environment, without any message\r\nto the end user. A `conflicts` is a better way to handle this.",
