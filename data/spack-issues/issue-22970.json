    "body": "<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2. Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack spec paraview\r\n...\r\nConcretized\r\n--------------------------------\r\n==> Error: invalid values for variant \"cuda_arch\" in package \"paraview\": ['10']\r\n```\r\nSame error when I select the cuda variant and appropriate architecture for my machine. \r\n \r\n```console\r\n$ spack spec paraview+cuda cuda_arch=pascal\r\n...\r\nConcretized\r\n--------------------------------\r\n==> Error: invalid values for variant \"cuda_arch\" in package \"paraview\": ['10']\r\n```\r\nWhat does  the \"['10']\" at the end of the error message mean? It seems that should help me debug the issue. \r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2041-1908e6834d\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n[compilers.yaml.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6305948/compilers.yaml.txt)\r\n[packages.yaml.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6305950/packages.yaml.txt)\r\n\r\nI don't think I have a build log since fails on 'spec'.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n@chuckatkins  @danlipsa  @vicentebolea\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
