    "body": "Adds a new variant to llvm: `cuda`, which if disabled (default), will set additional CMake variables so as to explicitly disable CUDA features from the llvm build.\r\n\r\nThese changes address an issue where a local cuda install outside of spack can leak into and break the build.  The variant doesn't add any dependencies on the `cuda` package, but perhaps it should?  Open to suggestions.",
