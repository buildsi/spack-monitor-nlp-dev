As the installed toolchain is getting relatively old, I was wondering what the support plans for later versions are, e.g. CentOS 8 (and possible follow-on project after end-of-life). \r\n\r\nSame question for Ubuntu for a Spack Docker-container for Focal Fossa.\r\n\r\n- https://wiki.centos.org/About/Product\r\n- https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Releases\r\n\r\nThanks",
