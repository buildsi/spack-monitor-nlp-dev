    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\n`spack stage -p <PATH> [args...]` is supposed to stage a particular package into a given directory so a user and/or spack developer can do some spelunking if necessary. However, this command currently fails if the directory structure with a `./spack-src` directory fails to exist. This is a relatively opaque error and hinders the act of spelunking.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Ensure the `-p` arg contains the correct directory structure for the `spack stage` command before attempting to stage anything.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\nThis particular option is now likely to work the way a user expects it to!",
