    "body": "- Introduce an opengl variant that is enabled by default. Disabling it allows building qt for X forwarding etc.\r\n- Depend on fontconfig and freetype to make use of system fonts. Otherwise qt can not find any fonts.\r\n- libx11 is required when libxcb is used.\r\n- Set MAKEFLAGS to parallelize qmake compilation.\r\n- Skip script component to make qt compile due to pcre problems (#1517).\r\n\r\n(Skipping script can probably be dropped when #4270 is merged.)",
