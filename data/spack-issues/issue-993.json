    "body": "The changes in this pull request make the following changes to the `metis` and `parmetis` packages:\n- Add installation support for package versions `metis@5.0.2` and `parmetis@4.0.2`.\n- Add a `url_for_version` function to each package to remove the need for per-version urls.\n- Change the `metis+double` variant to `metis+real64` to improve naming consistency with the `metis+idx64` variant.\n- Remove an unnecessary dependency in `metis` on the `gdb` package.\n- Improve the `metis@4` installation method by adding support for working with staged archives, fixing a few Linux installation errors, and adding better install error handling.\n- Update the code in these packages to conform to PEP8 standards.\n\nI've verified that the `metis@4.0.3/5.0.2+/~shared` and `parmetis@4.0.2+/~shared` variants of these packages compile and install properly on CHAOS when compiling with `gcc@4.7.2`.\n\n@goxberry, @davydden : Could you both verify that your installation variants for `metis` and `parmetis` still work before this PR is merged?  Thanks in advance for your help and please let me know if you have feedback on these changes.\n",
