    "body": "Fixes #26210 \r\n\r\nAs reported in the error, attempts to stage or install the package fail with `Connection reset by peer` errors.  This has been happening *at least* today for builds on different efforts (including CI/CD jobs).\r\n\r\nThis PR switches from the `http://www.qhull.org` URL for downloads to the GitHub repository, which appears to have all of the necessary versions PLUS an update.\r\n\r\nI am now able to successfully install the package for all of the explicitly listed versions.",
