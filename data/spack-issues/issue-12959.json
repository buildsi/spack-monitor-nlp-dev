    "body": "- added a spack package for chai\r\n- added appropriate build options to raja so raja can be built with chai.\r\n- updated the umpire revisions, as chai requires newer versions of umpire in order to compile.\r\n- disabled blt tests in chai + umpire, as the google test they use is incompatible with gcc@9.1.0\r\n",
