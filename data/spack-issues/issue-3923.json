    "body": "Fixes #3796 \r\n\r\nWe've gone over this a few times, but I'll say it again. Spack packages should not contain a `test` variant. The problem with this is that the hash/spec of an installed package should not change depending on whether or not `make check` was run. Adding a variant means that if you do something like:\r\n```\r\n$ spack install a+test\r\n$ spack install b\r\n```\r\nyou'll find `b` reinstalling `a~test`. Note that `a+test` and `a~test` _should_ be the same thing (in theory), so we don't want to reinstall it. We decided to add a `--run-tests` flag to `spack install` to control whether or not tests are run. This was decided on in #169 and implemented by @davydden in #1169. Note that we still need to add a `test` deptype, as proposed in #1279.",
