    "body": "This resolves a recently discovered issue where, due to the way gasnet is deployed in the current `legion` spackage, cross compilation and spack dependencies are not fully respected and this manifests as problematic on certain platforms.\r\n\r\nTo support these legacy dependents of legion and gasnet, the previous version of the rewritten gasnet spackage has been restored as `gasnet-legacy` so as to not interfere with use cases of the current `gasnet` spackage. This allows spack to fully deploy `gasnet-legacy` for builds of `legion` that require it and reenables support for certain platforms.\r\n\r\nThis has the additional bonus of allowing for older `legion` builds and reenabling support for spackages that disabled their legion variants as a result of the rewrites, but that will likely require significantly more effort and is being left for a later PR.",
