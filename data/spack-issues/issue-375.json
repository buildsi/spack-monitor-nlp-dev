    "body": "Modifications :\n- [x] added `flake8` ~~and `pep8`~~ checks to Travis\n- [x] added coverage results to unit tests\n- [x] added a style file for `yapf` which is conformant with the checks above\n\nNotes :\n- I didn't add `pylint` as it requires more set-up. According to the [documentation](http://docs.pylint.org/faq.html#running-pylint) it can be run only on packages or modules, not single files.\n\nFollows from #337 \n",
