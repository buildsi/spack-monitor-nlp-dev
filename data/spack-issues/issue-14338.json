    "body": "The imports in `spec.py` are getting to be pretty unwieldy.  This probably means the file needs to be broken up, but for now we can at least clean up the namespace.\r\n\r\n- [x] Remove all of the `import from` style imports and replace them with `import` or `import as`\r\n- [x] Remove a number names that were exported by `spack.spec` that weren't even in `spack.spec`",
