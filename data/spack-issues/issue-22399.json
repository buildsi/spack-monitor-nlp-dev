    "body": "Per discussion here: https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/21930#discussion_r596473192, when we add Spack Monitor in this PR, we will be writing to phase specific logs, e.g., that look like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ls opt/spack/linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake/gcc-9.3.0/ncurses-6.2-v3z5jtv4ztmho7onysxesbp2wqrrbn5x/.spack/\r\narchived-files            spack-build-01-autoreconf-out.txt  spack-build-env.txt\r\ninstall_environment.json  spack-build-02-configure-out.txt   spack-build-out.txt\r\ninstall_manifest.json     spack-build-03-build-out.txt       spack-configure-args.txt\r\nrepos                     spack-build-04-install-out.txt     spec.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n(Note the files that start with spack-build-* and include a number that indicates the step of the phase. To not potentially break any workflows that expect this file, a function `combine_phase_logs(pkg)` is added to the PR to cat them at the end (why we see `spack-build-out.txt` in the above). However, in the discussion, it seems that we don't need to keep this one compiled log. So this issue is a request from that discussion to refactor installer.py to remove `combine_phase_logs(pkg)`, and other areas of the code (e.g., other modules and tests) that are expecting to interact with this global lob. If you are reading this issue and you have a problem with removing this file, please also comment!",
