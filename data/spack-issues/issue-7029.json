    "body": "When using spack on a system supporting multiple python versions (i.e. both 2.7.x and 3.x) it would be very useful to be able to see the python version a particular module has been compiled against in the module name, rather than having to search through the pythonpath of that particular module. \r\n\r\nThis would be functionality similar to the current practice of including the compiler used to build the software in the module name.",
