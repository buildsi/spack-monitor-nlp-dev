    "body": "### Feature request.\r\n\r\nOutput buffers should be flushed at normal and exceptional program exit points.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nIn the case where the output of a Spack command is routed to a file (e.g. via `>build.log 2>&1`), the line few lines of output may be lost, causing issues (_e.g._) diagnosing problems. Even with `spack --debug`, the last line or two of a stack trace may be lost.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIn Spack main, at normal and exceptional exit points, flush `sys.stdout` and `sys.stderr` to prevent loss of possibly important diagnostic information due to block buffering.\r\n\r\n",
