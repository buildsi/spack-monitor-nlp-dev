    "body": "Rewiring is an operation on concrete, installed, spliced specs which carefully relocates any relevant prefixes throughout all the specs in a spliced DAG and then performs necessary operations for the spliced spec to be seen as \"installed.\" This operation remains somewhat \"dangerous\" and can lead to ABI breaks and other unexpected behavior. It should be used with caution.\r\nRewiring extends splicing (#20262) and honors all the semantics therein. For example, when a transitive splice is rewired, it will bring in all the dependencies of the newly-spliced dependency. Like splicing, rewiring is not destructive--it creates a new spec that conforms to the new spec from the splice.",
