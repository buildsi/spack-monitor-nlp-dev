    "body": "This change adds support for building the rocblas-test client and teaches spack how to run the fast subset of tests. I also tried to narrow down the cmake, python and rocm dependencies a bit. It takes ages to build Tensile, so I've only tested on 4.3.1 thus far.\r\n\r\nrocBLAS also supports using blis as a reference library. That would make the tests significantly faster, but the CMake for using blas is more or less the same for rocblas, hipblas (#27074), rocsolver (#26919) and hipsolver, so I figured I'd start with that.\r\n\r\nTo give it a spin, try:\r\n```\r\nspack install --verbose --test=root rocblas@4.3.1\r\n```\r\n\r\n@haampie @srekolam @arjun-raj-kuppala",
