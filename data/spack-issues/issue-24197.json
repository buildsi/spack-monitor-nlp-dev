Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nInstalling rust fails seemingly because the pre-build dependencies were compiled with a newer compiler than that of the OS (RedHat 8 with gcc 8.3.1)\r\n\r\nGLIBCXX_3.4.26 corresponds to `gcc@9.1.0` \r\n\r\n@AndrewGaspar - do you know if the binary objects used to bootstrap change regularly? The same rust version built correctly a few months ago.\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install rust\r\n...\r\n\r\nBuilding LLVM for x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\nrunning: \"cmake\" \"/tmp/dcsrsoft/spack-stage/spack-stage-rust-1.48.0-7t4ndux36cuxchdkk6swh6gylqdonprd/spack-src/src/llvm-project/llvm\" \"-G\" \"Ninja\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=AArch64;ARM;Hexagon;MSP430;Mips;NVPTX;PowerPC;RISCV;Sparc;SystemZ;WebAssembly;X86\" \"-DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=AVR\" \"-DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_INCLUDE_DOCS=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_TERMINFO=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_LIBEDIT=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_BINDINGS=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_Z3_SOLVER=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_PARALLEL_COMPILE_JOBS=48\" \"-DLLVM_TARGET_ARCH=x86_64\" \"-DLLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_ZLIB=ON\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_LIBXML2=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_VERSION_SUFFIX=-rust-1.48.0-stable\" \"-DCMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE=LAZY\" \"-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/dcsrsoft/spack/hetre/v1.2/spack/lib/spack/env/gcc/gcc\" \"-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/dcsrsoft/spack/hetre/v1.2/spack/lib/spack/env/gcc/g++\" \"-DCMAKE_ASM_COMPILER=/dcsrsoft/spack/hetre/v1.2/spack/lib/spack/env/gcc/gcc\" \"-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fPIC -m64\" \"-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fPIC -m64\" \"-DCMAKE_AR=/usr/bin/ar\" \"-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/dcsrsoft/spack-stage/spack-stage-rust-1.48.0-7t4ndux36cuxchdkk6swh6gylqdonprd/spack-src/build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/llvm\" \"-DCMAKE_ASM_FLAGS= -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fPIC -m64\" \"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\"\r\ncmake: /lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.26' not found (required by cmake)\r\nthread 'main' panicked at '\r\ncommand did not execute successfully, got: exit code: 1\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-2976-e37d663881\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThe problem is present for 1.51.0 and 1.48.0 (I haven't tried other versions) but interestingly 1.48.0 built correctly a month or so ago on the 21st of April:\r\n\r\nFrom the old spack-build-out.txt (attached as 20210421-spack-build-out.txt) we see:\r\n\r\n```\r\nrunning: \"cmake\" \"/tmp/dcsrsoft/spack-stage/spack-stage-rust-1.48.0-wkqpvor3c5sze6z25k2yxtrykt7h3kkr/spack-src/src/llvm-project/llvm\" \"-G\" \"Ninja\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_ASSERTIONS=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=AArch64;ARM;Hexagon;MSP430;Mips;NVPTX;PowerPC;RISCV;Sparc;SystemZ;WebAssembly;X86\" \"-DLLVM_EXPERIMENTAL_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=AVR\" \"-DLLVM_INCLUDE_EXAMPLES=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_INCLUDE_TESTS=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_INCLUDE_DOCS=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_INCLUDE_BENCHMARKS=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_TERMINFO=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_LIBEDIT=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_BINDINGS=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_Z3_SOLVER=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_PARALLEL_COMPILE_JOBS=48\" \"-DLLVM_TARGET_ARCH=x86_64\" \"-DLLVM_DEFAULT_TARGET_TRIPLE=x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_ZLIB=ON\" \"-DLLVM_ENABLE_LIBXML2=OFF\" \"-DLLVM_VERSION_SUFFIX=-rust-1.48.0-stable\" \"-DCMAKE_INSTALL_MESSAGE=LAZY\" \"-DCMAKE_C_COMPILER=/dcsrsoft/spack/hetre/v1.1/spack/lib/spack/env/gcc/gcc\" \"-DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=/dcsrsoft/spack/hetre/v1.1/spack/lib/spack/env/gcc/g++\" \"-DCMAKE_ASM_COMPILER=/dcsrsoft/spack/hetre/v1.1/spack/lib/spack/env/gcc/gcc\" \"-DCMAKE_C_FLAGS=-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fPIC -m64\" \"-DCMAKE_CXX_FLAGS=-ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fPIC -m64\" \"-DCMAKE_AR=/usr/bin/ar\" \"-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/tmp/dcsrsoft/spack-stage/spack-stage-rust-1.48.0-wkqpvor3c5sze6z25k2yxtrykt7h3kkr/spack-src/build/x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu/llvm\" \"-DCMAKE_ASM_FLAGS= -ffunction-sections -fdata-sections -fPIC -m64\" \"-DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release\"\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
