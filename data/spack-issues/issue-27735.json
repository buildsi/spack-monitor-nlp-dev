    "body": "This allow one to have two packages that depend on say `llvm targets=NVPTX` and\n`llvm targets=AMDGPU` which Spack would merge into `targets=NVPTX,AMDGPU`.\n\nThe default is `targets=auto`, which corresponds with\n`LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD=all`, and gives a reasonable user experience when just\nrunning `spack install llvm+clang`.\n\nWith this change, Spack will always add LLVM's host arch as an enabled target,\nso even if you don't specify `targets=X86`, if your Spack target arch is say\n`znver2`, it will add `X86` to `LLVM_TARGETS_TO_BUILD`. This is mostly so that\nthe user doesn't have to do the mapping from spack -> LLVM target, and can just\ndepend on the \"special\" targets.\n\n\n",
