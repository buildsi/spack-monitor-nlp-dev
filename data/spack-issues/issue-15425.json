    "body": "If I create an environment and the name contains -h within the name, trying to activate the environment fails to work.  I've tried this with many combinations.  I originally tried with the name 'SpEC-gcc630-haswell', wanting to specify precisely what was in this particular environment.  I finally realized it was the -h within the name causing problems.\r\n\r\n### Spack version\r\n0.14.0-22-8d750db\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n```console\r\n$ . ~/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh\r\n$ spack env create test-h\r\n$ spack env activate test-h\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n```\r\n==> This command works best with Spack's shell support\r\n  \r\n  To initialize spack's shell commands:\r\n  \r\n      # for bash and zsh\r\n      . /home/binary/SPACK/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh\r\n  \r\n      # for csh and tcsh\r\n      setenv SPACK_ROOT /home/binary/SPACK/spack\r\n      source /home/binary/SPACK/spack/share/spack/setup-env.csh\r\n  \r\n  Or, if you want to use `spack env activate` without initializing\r\n  shell support, you can run one of these:\r\n  \r\n      eval `spack env activate --sh test-h`   # for bash/sh\r\n      eval `spack env activate --csh test-h`  # for csh/tcsh\r\n```\r\n### Information on your system\r\nI have found the same problem on Ubuntu and Redhat systems.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n",
