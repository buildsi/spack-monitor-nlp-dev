    "body": "We got rid of `master` after #17377, but users still want a way to get the latest stable release without knowing its number.\r\n\r\nWe've added a `releases/latest` tag to replace what was once the `master` branch. Note that unlike `master` in Git Flow, `releases/latest` is a tag, not a branch. It's just a pointer to the latest release.\r\n\r\ncc: @bradcray @ankingcodes.",
