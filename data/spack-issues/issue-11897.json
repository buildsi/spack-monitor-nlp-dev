    "body": "This removes some unnecessary noqa's from the Spack code.  Specifically:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    '\\{name}',  # NOQA: ignore=W605\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis one is actually borderline erroneous, as it relies on `'\\{'` not being a valid escape sequence. If at some point it _became_ a valid escape, the code would be wrong.\r\n\r\nLines like the above one should either be written:\r\n```python\r\n    '\\\\{name}',\r\n```\r\n\r\nor (probably preferable):\r\n```python\r\n    r'\\{name}',\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've found that `W605` is nearly always raised correctly -- we should pay attention to it.\r\n\r\ncc: @becker33 @scheibelp \r\n",
