    "body": "I'm trying to install a newer version of Mesa, but there's a lot of missing Xorg dependencies needed for DRI and hardware acceleration.\n\nI decided to take a swing at packaging all of Xorg/X11/XCB, or at least the important parts. Everything can be found at https://www.x.org/archive/individual/. Here is my progress so far:\n- [x] app - packaged, some are missing dependencies\n- [x] data - Miscellaneous data, mostly for xcursor and xkeyboard\n- [x] doc - documentation utilities\n- [ ] driver - hardware-specific drivers\n- [x] font - fonts and font-related utilities\n- [x] lib - the actually important stuff\n- [x] proto - protocol extensions/headers heavily used by Xorg libraries\n- [x] test - packaged but not yet tested\n- [x] util - m4 macros used by most Xorg packages\n- [x] xcb - same as in https://xcb.freedesktop.org/dist/\n- [x] xserver - packaged, missing dependencies\n",
