    "body": "We want to be able to generate software bills of material (sboms) for spack packages. These changes add:\r\n\r\n -  a new install flag --sbom that asks to generate one in the install directory\r\n -  a command group spack sbom to view an existing path, show an existing sbom in the terminal, or create a new sbom on te fly\r\n - tests and documentation for that.\r\n\r\nCycloneDX seems to be a reasonable format to choose, however we could add more in the future if needed. I've also implemented this as a hook so it was easy to add post install success. \r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
