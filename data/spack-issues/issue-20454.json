Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install automake@1.16.3%intel@19.0.4.243 arch=linux-rhel7-broadwell\r\n...\r\n2 errors found in build log:\r\n     100      GEN      bin/aclocal-1.16\r\n     101      GEN      doc/aclocal-1.16.1\r\n     102      GEN      bin/automake-1.16\r\n     103      GEN      doc/automake-1.16.1\r\n     104    help2man: can't get `--help' info from aclocal-1.16\r\n     105    Try `--no-discard-stderr' if option outputs to stderr\r\n  >> 106    make: *** [doc/aclocal-1.16.1] Error 126\r\n     107    make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....\r\n     108    help2man: can't get `--help' info from automake-1.16\r\n     109    Try `--no-discard-stderr' if option outputs to stderr\r\n  >> 110    make: *** [doc/automake-1.16.1] Error 126\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-281-a879c875d\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.3\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-broadwell\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThis was found during a build of paraview%intel, but I will test with gcc too. automake@1.16.2 builds fine. I can provide more information if needed. Just wanted to get this up before I forget about it. \r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists.\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt]()\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt]() -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers \r\nDoesn't look like there are maintainers listed.\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
