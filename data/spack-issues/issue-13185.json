    "body": "I'm still working on some straggler packages, but this covers nearly all of the MD5 hashes in Spack.  [NIST recommends](https://csrc.nist.gov/Projects/Hash-Functions/NIST-Policy-on-Hash-Functions) that projects move away from MD5, and we've been meaning to do this for a while.\r\n\r\nNow that #12940 is available, we can fetch everything and hash it.  I've done that and re-written packages with SHA256's instead of with MD5 (or other algorithms).\r\n\r\nI will also add tests to enforce this, and the use of kwarg labels on hashes (i.e., `sha256=\"abc123abc123\"` instead of just `\"abc123abc123\"`).\r\n\r\nAlso, this makes the use of SHA256 consistent across Spack.  In addition to using a better hashing algorithm, we'd like to use a *consistent* checksum scheme everywhere so that we can eventually:\r\n\r\n  1. incorporate archive checksums into our specs and have a consistent hashing algorithm across all specs (and distinguish between multiple releases of the same version with different tarballs).\r\n  2. index mirrors with a consistent type of checksum, and not one that is dependent on how spack packages are written.\r\n\r\n(2) is a reason this should go in *before* #12940 -- if we don't put this in first, mirrors using the new layout will need to be re-fetched (or at least reorganized) when hashes change.\r\n\r\n- [x] convert existing md5, sha224, sha512, sha1 checksums to sha256\r\n- [x] test to enforce use of `sha256=` in new packages\r\n\r\n@citibeth FYI.",
