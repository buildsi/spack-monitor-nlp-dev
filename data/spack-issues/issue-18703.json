    "body": "This PR fixes a couple of things with the libbeagle package.\r\n\r\n- libbeagle can only be built for one GPU type. Add a test for that.\r\n- version 2 had the arch statement in\r\n  libhmsbeagle/GPU/kernels/Makefile.am but version 3 has it in\r\n  configure.ac. Put the variant specified value in configure.ac for\r\n  consistency.",
