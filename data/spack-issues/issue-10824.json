Now Spack has three versions of libuv: 1.9.0, 1.10.0 and 1.25.0. \r\n* specifying `libuv@1.0.0:1.10.99` dependency for `cmake@3.7.0:3.10.3` since `libuv@1.25.0` fails to build cmake of these versions.\r\n* specifying `libuv@1.10.0:1.10.99` dependency for `cmake@3.11.0:3.11.99` since `libuv@1.25.0` fails to build `cmake@3.11.x`.\r\n* specifying `libuv@1.10.0:` dependency for `cmake@3.12.0:` since the latest `liuv@1.25.0` works well with `cmake@3.12.0` later on.\r\n\r\nThe following specs are built succesfully:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack install cmake@3.9.0\r\n$ spack install cmake@3.10.0\r\n$ spack install cmake@3.11.0\r\n$ spack install cmake@3.12.0\r\n```",
