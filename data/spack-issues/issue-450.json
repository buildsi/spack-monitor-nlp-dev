    "body": "Adding a trunk version to the llvm package.  This has all the features\nand requirements of the others, with the additional caveat that the llvm\nproject makes no guarantee that trunk on all repositories together will\nnecessarily make a working compiler.  It has been tested, and worked\nwith a version today, but not yesterday, so if you test keep that in\nmind.\n",
