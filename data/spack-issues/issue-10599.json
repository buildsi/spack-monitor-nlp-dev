    "body": "Add support for finding / configuring PGI LLVM with `spack compiler find`.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nPGI 2018 includes a production version of the PGI Linux/x86-64 compilers with an LLVM code generator and OpenMP runtime. It includes most features, languages, and programming model support found in the default PGI compilers, as well as the PGI debugger and profiler.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n```\r\n[joan5896@shas0136 ~]$ spack compiler add --scope=site /curc/sw/spack/summit/opt/spack/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/pgi-18.4-p3oqv4mfexi5soq4lvfhb4vkrl4cpxqj/linux86-64-llvm/18.4\r\n==> Found no new compilers\r\n==> Compilers are defined in the following files:\r\n    /curc/sw/spack/summit/etc/spack/compilers.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should either find `pgi%18.4`, or a new compiler `pgi-llvm%18.4` (preferred, I think)",
