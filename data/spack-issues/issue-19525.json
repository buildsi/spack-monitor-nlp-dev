    "body": "Hi everyone,\r\n\r\nI wanted to update the current version of the python package `py-sympy` (to use `multigamma`, for example).\r\n\r\nAnd I found its information in:\r\nhttps://github.com/sympy/sympy/releases\r\n\r\nI am testing this in my local machine (with a full `spack` installation - and python 3.8.6) and it seems to work well.\r\n\r\nIt might be useful to update also the *url* to the `.tar.gz` files for the recent versions (which seems to be different now).\r\nWhat do you think?\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nDiana",
