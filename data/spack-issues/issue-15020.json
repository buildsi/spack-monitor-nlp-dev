    "body": "When working on packages, occasionally I'll need to change the source URL. If I subsequently do `spack uninstall <x>; spack install <x>` this will not result in the new source being downloaded and will instead reuse the previous source. This is both confusing and a little risky as you can easily miss this and end up with bad code in production.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install <spec>\r\n(change source URL in <spec>)\r\n$ spack uninstall <spec>\r\n$ spack install <spec>\r\n(new source is not downloaded)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n",
