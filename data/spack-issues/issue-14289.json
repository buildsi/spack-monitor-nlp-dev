    "body": "refers to #13485\r\n\r\nThis commit removes the `python_version.py` unit test module and the vendored dependencies `pyqver2.py` and `pyqver3.py`. It substitutes them with an equivalent check done using `vermin` that is run as a separate workflow via Github Actions. Rationale is to remove 2 vendored and unmaintained dependencies and use instead a maintained tool.\r\n\r\nVermin is currently run with Python 2 because of https://github.com/netromdk/vermin/issues/32",
