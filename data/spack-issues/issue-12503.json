    "body": "SEACAS is now using versions instead of just relying on always installing `master`.  There are now tagged versions.\r\nThe most recent version is the first that can be used with a non-patched `develop` version of the CGNS package; previously, seacas required that the CGNS library have some internally-developed patch applied, but this is no longer needed.\r\n\r\nAlso, added support for `adios2` package with the `adios2` variant.  This currently defaults to off.",
