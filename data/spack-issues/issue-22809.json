    "body": "The Parallel-NetCDF package does not explicitly set the environment variables for MPICC/MPICXX.  This depends on MPI provides to set those ENVs, but in some cases this does not happen. E.g., PR #22732.\r\n\r\nThe package also does not set the variables that define how to run the tests. Sometimes the package's tests launch, but it is dependent on configure choosing the right launcher, which is non trivial.\r\n\r\nThis patch provides support for setting several different launchers (`aprun, srun, jsrun, mpiexec, and mpirun`)\r\n\r\nPlease consider accepting this PR!\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n@skosukhin ",
