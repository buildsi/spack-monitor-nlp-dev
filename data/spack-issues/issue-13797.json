The old rpaths are recreated by getting the nromalized path of the directory name of the original file path name added combined with the relative rpath. The old rpaths are then replace with new rpaths using the prefix to prefix dictionary. Then the relativized rpath is then calculated with respect to the new directory layout. The same thing is done with relativized symbolic links.\r\n\r\nSymbolic links to the absolute path of the package install prefix are replaced, all others produce warnings.",
