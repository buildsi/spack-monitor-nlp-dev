    "body": "Create an API that allows new repo types to be added to the Spack core codebase.  The goal would be to eventually allow for all of GitHub to act as one repo.

But for now, the idea is to create and define the API as things currently stand; and then change it if needed.\n\n@DavidPoliakoff @tgamblin @alalazo \n",
