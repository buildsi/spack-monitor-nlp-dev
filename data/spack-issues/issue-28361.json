    "body": "### Summary\n\nWhen a package has a preferred version, I'd like to know why it is preferred. Similarly for deprecated versions.\r\n\n\n### Rationale\n\nWhen I want to use a particular version, and Spack tells me otherwise, I need to know whether to trust Spack, or whether to open a PR removing an outdated constraint.\r\n\r\nThis may also prevent me from going into rabbit holes where others have been before.\n\n### Description\n\nA new (mandatory) field `reason=\"human-readable string\"` would help. A requirement that a comment explains the reason (similar to how the reason for patches need explaining) would also work.\n\n### Additional information\n\n$ spack --version\r\n0.17.1-778-2ab871dd17\r\n\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
