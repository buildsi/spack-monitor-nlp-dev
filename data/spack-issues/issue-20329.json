    "body": "This is a small pull request to add an option to use an ipython interpreter for developers, which is my preference (and maybe others too?) Basically, you can specify it like this:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ spack python -i ipython\r\nPython 3.8.3 (default, May 19 2020, 18:47:26) \r\nType 'copyright', 'credits' or 'license' for more information\r\nIPython 7.17.0 -- An enhanced Interactive Python. Type '?' for help.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpack version 0.16.0\r\nPython 3.8.3, Linux x86_64\r\n\r\nIn [1]:\r\n```\r\nI replaced the console.runsource with a simple exec, since embed() essentially includes all the locals anyway. For running commands/files I force the user to use python, because while it works to use ipython, it doesn't make sense for a non-interactive use case. \r\n\r\nThis is my first PR in a long time so I suspect the formatting will be wrong, I'll follow up with fixes when the CI tells me I'm a wet noodle.",
