    "body": "Looking at how the conversation evolved here, I think it is worthwhile to keep the issue open as a reminder to document how to build a pipeline around the stages of a build system. The particular issue that @davydden was encountering will be solved differently by #4470 \r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n##### Original post from @davydden \r\n\r\nI probably missed that, but is there some documentation on how to use arbitrary stages in build, recently contributed by @alalazo ? \r\n\r\nI am just trying to figure out how to add a stage which should run `filter_file()` after installation of the package?",
