    "body": "In the process of iterating on https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/24274 , version 1.17 of DD4hep was renamed from \"01-17-00\" to \"01-17\", in line with the naming conventions of previous releases. Since release archives contain a subdirectory with the version string in it, this changes the contents of the tarball ever so slightly, so the SHA-256 checksum must change as well.",
