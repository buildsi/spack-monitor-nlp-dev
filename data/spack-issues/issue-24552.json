    "body": "I'm not sure if this is a bug or the package is intentionally left out, but I noticed that mpi doesn't come through in listing packages via spack.repo.all_package.names:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nall_packages = spack.repo.all_package_names(include_virtuals=True)\r\nfor package in os.listdir('/home/vanessa/Desktop/Code/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/'):\r\n   ...:     if package not in all_packages:\r\n   ...:         print(package)\r\n   ...:\r\nmpi\r\n```\r\nIt's definitely a folder (as shown above) and it doesn't show up whether I do include_virtuals as True or not. What am I missing?\r\n\r\nThe package is defined as virtual=True, but I guess my thinking is that include_virtuals=True would have it show up.",
