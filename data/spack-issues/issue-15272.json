    "body": "- add version info for v1.8.0\r\n\r\n- v1.8.0 adds a new source file, `file.c`, which need to be included\r\n  in our hardcoded list of objects to link.\r\n\r\n  I discovered this while demonstrating \"how easy it is to add a new\r\n  package to Spack\", only to scratch my head when it failed `spack\r\n  install` but worked when I ran `make` in the stage dir.  Finally\r\n  looked at tree/package.py and it All Became Clear.\r\n\r\n  Perhaps someone should rewrite this to use MakefilePackage, but the\r\n  Makefile starts off with a bunch of twisty turny \"uncomment these\r\n  lines to run on this platform\", so it might not be worth it.",
