    "body": "Conflicts on default variant values of providers of blas/lapack/fftw-api makes clingo rather choose a different provider.\r\n\r\nInstead we can formulate the double negative with a single conditional depends_on, which is a nice trick to stick to preferred providers.\r\n\r\nWith this change cp2k picks up openblas threads=openmp for me instead of amdblis, and indeed openblas is my preferred blas/lapack provider.\r\n",
