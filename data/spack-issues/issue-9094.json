    "body": "This is old and long-abandoned HEP software, but for some reason a few important projects still rely on it.\r\n\r\nAs the package does not have a readily usable and well-documented automated installation mechanism, one needs to guess how to install things. I know how to install the C++ headers, which is what is usually needed, but there are also documentation and java files in that package which I don't know how to deal with.\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, Spack does not usually install docs, and no one is currently using the Java version of AIDA, so perhaps just installing the C++ headers is enough. If not, a bit of help from Java folks would be handy in order to get the installation right :)",
