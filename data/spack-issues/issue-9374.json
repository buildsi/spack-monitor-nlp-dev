    "body": "Module parsing (to extract package paths from associated module files of Spack external packages) was potentially missing cases where a module named something like `foo-bar/1.0.0` set an environment variable like `FOO_BAR_DIR`, and in that case not finding the package.\r\n\r\nThis adds some formatting steps when checking the contents of `module show` for a variable set by the module based on the package name.\r\n\r\nThis is related to https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/9232 but technically this type of parsing would be required for either strategy (in the case of #9232 it's a matter of checking for the right environment variable).",
