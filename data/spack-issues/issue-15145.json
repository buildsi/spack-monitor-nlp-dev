    "body": "As a Spack maintainer I want to remove the `spack bootstrap` command (outdated since #14062) so that I could reduce the amount of boilerplate code in the project.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThe `spack bootstrap` command was used to \"Bootstrap packages needed for spack to run smoothly\" and in reality it has always just installed `environment-modules~X`. Since #14062 shell integration  doesn't require `environment-modules` anymore making the command outdated. I would  therefore remove that command from the code base.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nJust remove the command and any test / package associated only with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nOpening the issue to check what is the consensus towards this.\r\n",
