    "body": "Alter the `install_components/install` script to pass the `-gcc $SPACK_CC`,\r\n`-gpp $SPACK_CXX`, and `-g77 $SPACK_F77` flags to `makelocalrc`.  This\r\nensures that nvhpc is configured to use the spack gcc spec, rather than\r\nwhatever gcc is found on the path.\r\n\r\nThis commit also patches `makelocalrc` to *append* `/usr/bin` and `/bin`\r\nto the path, rather than prepending them.  This gives precendence to\r\nmodule-loaded compilers over those found in system directories.  This change\r\nshould be made in the nvhpc binary distribution.",
