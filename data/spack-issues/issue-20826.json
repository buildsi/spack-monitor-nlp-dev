    "body": "Add early support for ROCM on AMD GPUs, for develop branch only.\r\nRequires ROCM packages to be specified as external packages.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nNo, it doesn't work to add ROCmPackage.  That adds dependencies for\r\nhip, hsa-rocr-dev and llvm-amdgpu.\r\n\r\nHpctoolkit is not a ROCM application, it is a tool for analyzing apps.\r\nFor ROCM, we need hip, rocm-dbgapi and roctracer-dev.",
