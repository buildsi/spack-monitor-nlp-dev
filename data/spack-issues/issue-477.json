    "body": "Modifications:\n- [x] Stage is now a context manager\n- [x] `package.do_install`, `mirror.create` and the tests have been updated accordingly\n- [x] `_setup` has been removed from Stage, its logic has been simplified and is now part of `__enter__`\n- [x] `Stage._cleanup_dead_links` and `remove_link_tree` have been moved to `llnl.util.filesytsem`\n- [x] removed `Package.do_clean`\n\n@tgamblin this goes in the direction of cleaning a bit `Stage` and `FetchStrategy`. I guess the best way to proceed is to submit a moderately small PR like this at a time. Just let me know if you prefer something different (like a long-term refactoring branch or similar)\n",
