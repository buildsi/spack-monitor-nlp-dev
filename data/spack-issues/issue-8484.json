    "body": "Closes #4503 (implementing the spirit of the request&mdash;parallelism for CMake tests&mdash;rather than the spirit&mdash;using the `ctest` command itself).\r\n\r\nThe existing implementation of the test target when building a CMake package using the Makefiles generator invokes `make test`, which does not honor the the `-j` option for parallelism. One can either set an environment variable ~~(difficult to handle the overrides currently available)~~ or one can invoke `ctest` instead of `make test`. This implementation (now) does the ~~latter~~ former in order to accommodate packages (see below) for which `make test` runs a set of tests which is distinct from that run by `ctest`.\r\n\r\n[Description has been edited from the original due to the evolution of implementation to satisfy issues raised), with some phrases struck through to suggest the original meaning. See the editing history for full details.",
