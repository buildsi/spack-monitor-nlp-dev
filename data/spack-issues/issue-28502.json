    "body": "My last builds failed du to `py-numpy` not being installed.\r\n\r\nI though it previously was a dependency of `boost+python+numpy` on which `tfel+python_bindings` depends, which obviously makes sense. As a matter of fact, something is now broken.\r\n\r\nAdding an explicit dependency to `py-numpy`  fixes things.\r\n",
