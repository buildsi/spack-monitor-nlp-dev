    "body": "### Problem\r\nIn several cases where we re-raise an exception, we lose the traceback pointing to the original source of the exception. Python 3's `raise <exception> from <exception>` syntax was created to join these exception tracebacks.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\nSince we still support python 2.7, we can't use `raise ... from ...` directly, but `six.raise_from()` will do this when running in python 3. We use `six.raise_from()` calls whenever we re-raise a new exception.\r\n\r\nSeparately, some of these exception re-raises are not currently tested. In order to pass `codecov/patch`, we need to add a few further tests to cover the branches we modified to use `six.raise_from()`. These uncovered branches all occur in the methods to parse `Spec`, `Mirror`, and `MirrorCollection` from YAML/JSON.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\nWe now have full exception tracebacks in all cases where we re-raise an exception!",
