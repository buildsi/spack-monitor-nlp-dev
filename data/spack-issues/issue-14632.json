    "body": "All of a sudden, all of our recent PRs have been failing the \"python version check\" GitHub action. It looks like a new, smarter version of vermin (0.10.0) was just released today, detecting new incompatible sections of code. Luckily all of these versions are guarded by `sys.version_info` checks or try-except blocks. This PR adds `# novm` to the lines that were causing the tests to fail.",
