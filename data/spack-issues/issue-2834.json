Needed a newer version of `isl` to get llvm/clang in the current trunk to build via spack, but there are more versions available.\r\n\r\nWhat is the policy regarding those ~7 other intermediate versions? Just add the latest stable for now?\r\n\r\nP.S.: still problems installing `libc++` in `llvm@trunk`",
