    "body": "Currently, `spack mirror create bzip2` fails with the following error:\r\n```\r\n==> Warning: Error while fetching bzip2@1.0.6\r\n  global name 'spack_cc' is not defined\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is due to the fact that `mirror create` invokes `do_patch`, which calls the package's `patch` method. Since `mirror create` does not set up the appropriate environment, variables like `spack_cc` are not set.\r\n\r\nThis change introduces `fetch` and `clean` methods for patches. They are no-ops for `FilePatch` but perform the appropriate actions for `UrlPatch`. This allows `mirror create` to invoke `do_fetch`, which does not call the package's `patch` method.",
