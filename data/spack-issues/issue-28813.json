    "body": "The `has_test_method` checks a package for having a stand-alone test method defined.  It belongs with the package, not the `test` subcommand.  There are some pending PRs that would benefit from having the method in the core, and not command, modules.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves the method and an associated unit test to a more visible module.",
