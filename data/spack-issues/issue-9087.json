    "body": "Fixes #9037.\r\n\r\nHowever, this also uncovers another bug. When I try to build the latest version of numpy, all of the tests pass, but right before the installation finishes, I see the following error message:\r\n```\r\n==> Error: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: '/Users/Adam/spack/var/spack/stage/py-numpy-1.15.1-axflucalynpnnr5camla655764dpyvqz/.pytest_cache/spack-build.out'\r\n\r\n/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/package.py:1652, in log:\r\n       1649            # FIXME : this potentially catches too many things...\r\n       1650            pass\r\n       1651\r\n  >>   1652        # Archive the whole stdout + stderr for the package\r\n       1653        install(self.log_path, log_install_path)\r\n       1654        # Archive the environment used for the build\r\n       1655        install(self.env_path, env_install_path)\r\n```\r\nThe correct `spack-build.out` is in `numpy-1.15.1`, not `.pytest_cache`. Does anyone have any idea why the `log_path` is being overwritten? This doesn't happen if I install without `--test=root`.\r\n\r\nP.S. I could've sworn I fixed the error message off-by-one line number bug.",
