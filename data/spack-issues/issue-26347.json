    "body": "Searching for `Kokkos` when testing `ArborX` might find a different version from what was installed and that one might export incompatible flags because it was compiled with a different compiler and targeting a different backend.\r\nSince the package testing considers the whole environment and not just the `spack` system, the tests might fail if other `Kokkos` versions not maintained by `spack` are installed.\r\nIn order to be able to test already released `ArborX`, it seems best to just set the `Kokkos` path explicitly to the one specified at installation.",
