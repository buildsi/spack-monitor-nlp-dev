    "body": "When sourced in an emulation mode other than zsh, the zsh setup code in\r\nspack-completion.bash wasn't correctly initializing completion and bash\r\ncompletion before using commands defined only after that's done.  This\r\nensures that we detect that case by checking for the bash `complete`\r\nfunction, and if that is missing we initialize the completion stack and\r\nre-source.  Otherwise, if it's already there, just load the rest of the\r\nfile and be done.  Should be slightly faster as well as correct in more\r\ncases.\r\n\r\nfixes #20551",
