    "body": "<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2. Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\nReproducible on CentOS 7, as well as (I suspect) any platform where native compiler in `/usr/bin` uses an old ABI.\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install gcc@7.5.0\r\n$ spack compiler add --scope site $(spack location -i gcc@7.5.0)\r\n$ spack install root@6.22.06%gcc@7.5.0\r\n```\r\nCompilation succeeds. However...\r\n```console\r\n$ spack load gcc@7.5.0 root@6.22.06\r\n$ echo '#include \"TObject.h\"\\nstruct Test : public TObject {\\nClassDef(Test, 1)\\n};' >Test.h\r\n$ rootcling Test_dict.cxx Test.h\r\nError in <TInterpreter::InspectMembers>: TClass and cling disagree on the size of the class TBaseClass, respectively 152 128\r\n\r\nError in <TInterpreter::InspectMembers>: TClass and cling disagree on the size of the class TClassRef, respectively 40 16\r\n\r\nError in <TInterpreter::InspectMembers>: TClass and cling disagree on the size of the class TClassRef, respectively 40 16\r\n```\r\nThe errors indicate an ABI mismatch between the compiler that was used to build ROOT (gcc 7.5.0) and the compiler that was used to inspect the `Test.h` header file. Indeed, running `rootcling` under `strace` shows that `rootcling` seems to invoke the compiler as `cc`. There is no such symlink in the `gcc` Spack installation, so the link is found in `/usr/bin/cc`, which points to `/usr/bin/gcc`. This was really tricky to figure out! I discussed the issue at length with the ROOT developers [here](https://root-forum.cern.ch/t/tclass-and-cling-disagree-on-the-size-of-the-class/44831).\r\n\r\nI would argue that this is a Spack bug. First of all, ROOT really depends on the compiler it was used to build it, although I don't know if Spack is capable of expressing (I don't think we can use `depends_on()`) and enforcing this dependence. Second, the build is broken, but subtly so. I would argue that this is much worse than a package that does not compile.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2700-57017d5\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-skylake_avx512\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\nI tested this in an environment with this configuration:\r\n```console\r\n$ cat spack.yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  specs: [gcc@7.5.0%gcc@7.5.0, python@3.9.0, root@6.22.06 ~opengl ~gdml ~xml ~x ^python@3.9.0]\r\n  view: true\r\n  packages:\r\n    all:\r\n      target: [x86_64]\r\n```\r\nThe additional build flags for ROOT are simply there to remove some dependencies from the concretized spec and accelerate the build.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6539104/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6539105/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n@HadrienG2 @chissg @drbenmorgan @vvolkl \r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
