    "body": "This PR adds two new versions (`1.0rc1` and `develop`) and missing dependencies (CMake and Argobots) to the BOLT package.\r\nNote that this BOLT package previously uses a built-in Argobots, but it complicates the version control. The Argobots/BOLT team would like to separate it from the BOLT package.",
