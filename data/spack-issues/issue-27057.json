    "body": "As was mentioned in #10088 there are certain things that expect `CUDA_HOME` to be set. One can also search for `CUDA_HOME` in [var/spack/repos/builtin/packages](https://github.com/spack/spack/tree/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages). I am actually quite surprised that we still don't have it. Do I miss something and that has already been discussed?",
