    "body": "fixes #22822\r\n\r\nWhen preparing stages etc. we expect the command to decompress an archive to write its output in the current working directory. This is not the case for `gunzip` that instead works in place by default. Here we solve the issue by substituting a system call with the use of the `gzip` module from the Python standard library.",
