    "body": "In cases where the system python install and lib/spack/external have the same library installed this will use what is placed in lib/spack/external. \n\nThis requires modifying the names of some modules in lib/spack/external in cases where both the system python and backported features of future python versions (i.e. after 2.6) are used (previously distinguished by \"from external import X\" and \"import X\").\n\nNote: all unit tests passed before I edited any of the commands. Nearly all of them needed their imports updated (\"from external import argparse\" -> \"import argparse\"). I have not tested all of them myself.\n",
