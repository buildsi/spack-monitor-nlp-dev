    "body": "Setting PETSC_DIR this way breaks building PETSc; apparently, this also sets PETSC_DIR while building PETSc, and this doesn't work.\n\nWhy is the location of PETSc exported via an environment variable anyway? Spack should have a mechanism for this (modules?), and if it doesn't, such a mechanism should be introduced. Otherwise, each package should have such a function and export its location.\n",
