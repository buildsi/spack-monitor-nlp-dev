    "body": "### Summary\n\n\r\nRequesting the addition of a flag to check if recipes and patches are tracked in Git.\n\n### Rationale\n\nIf you're developing new recipes and adding patches to them in a large build tree, it is easy to forget to \"git add\" \r\nthings... until you check out a copy somewhere else and the build breaks.\r\n\n\n### Description\n\n\r\nA flag one can turn on in the config that has the code that imports recipes and the code that applies (local) patches ensure that the files thus accessed are tracked in git, and issues a warning if not, would be helpful to absent-minded developers like me. \r\n\r\nIt would also probably need a cache for such information so as not to slow the whole thing to a crawl. as  lots of Spack commands import the recipes...\r\n\n\n### Additional information\n\nI am currently using spack 0.16.1\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
