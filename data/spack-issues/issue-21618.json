    "body": "We have been using the `@llnl.util.lang.key_ordering` decorator for specs and most of their components. This leverages the fact that in Python, tuple comparison is lexicographic. It allows you to implement a `_cmp_key` method on your class, and have `__eq__`, `__lt__`, etc. implemented automatically using that key. For example, you might use tuple keys to implement comparison, e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nclass Widget:\r\n    # author implements this\r\n    def _cmp_key(self):\r\n        return (\r\n            self.a,\r\n            self.b,\r\n            (self.c, self.d),\r\n            self.e\r\n        )\r\n\r\n    # operators are generated by @key_ordering\r\n    def __eq__(self, other):\r\n        return self._cmp_key() == other._cmp_key()\r\n\r\n    def __lt__(self):\r\n        return self._cmp_key() < other._cmp_key()\r\n\r\n    # etc.\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe issue there for simple comparators is that we have to build the tuples *and* we have to generate all the values in them up front. When implementing comparisons for large data structures, this can be costly.\r\n\r\nThis PR replaces `@key_ordering` with a new decorator, `@lazy_lexicographic_ordering`. Lazy lexicographic comparison maps the tuple comparison shown above to generator functions. Instead of comparing based on pre-constructed tuple keys, users of this decorator can compare using elements from a generator. So, you'd write:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n@lazy_lexicographic_ordering\r\nclass Widget:\r\n    def _cmp_iter(self):\r\n        yield a\r\n        yield b\r\n        def cd_fun():\r\n            yield c\r\n            yield d\r\n        yield cd_fun\r\n        yield e\r\n\r\n    # operators are added by decorator (but are a bit more complex)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThere are no tuples that have to be pre-constructed, and the generator does not have to complete. Instead of tuples, we simply make functions that lazily yield what would've been in the tuple. If a yielded value is a `callable`, the comparison functions will call it and recursively compare it. The comparator just walks the data structure like you'd expect it to.\r\n\r\nThe ``@lazy_lexicographic_ordering`` decorator handles the details of implementing comparison operators, and the ``Widget`` implementor only has to worry about writing ``_cmp_iter``, and making sure the elements in it are also comparable.\r\n\r\nUsing this PR shaves another 1.5 sec off the runtime of `spack buildcache list`, and it also speeds up Spec comparison by about 30%. The runtime improvement comes mostly from two things:\r\n\r\n1. lazily stopping the comparison as soon as possible (e.g., many specs just have different names, which is the firs thing the lazy generators return)\r\n2. avoiding the use of `hash()`  in `_cmp_iter()` (it was used in `_cmp_key()` before)",
