    "body": "I'm working on a package that requires libblas.so, liblapack.so, and libatlas.so. It specifically recommends using OpenBLAS for BLAS/LAPACK. However, I would also need to depend on ATLAS to get libatlas.so, right? Spack doesn't currently allow this, since you can't have multiple providers for the same virtual dependency. I tried specifically depending on openblas and atlas instead of blas and lapack, but that didn't help. Am I doing something wrong, or do I just not understand how blas, lapack, and atlas are related?\n",
