    "body": "This is an additional commit on top of https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/25409\r\n\r\nWith this PR we can activate an environment in Spack itself, without computing changes to environment variables only necessary for \"shell aware\" env activation.\r\n\r\n1. Activating an environment:\r\n    \r\n    ```python\r\n    spack.environment.activate(Environment(xyz)) -> None\r\n    ```\r\n    this basically just sets `_active_environment` and modifies some config scopes.\r\n\r\n2. Activating an environment **and** getting environment variable modifications for the shell:\r\n\r\n    ```python\r\n    spack.environment.shell.activate(Environment(xyz)) -> EnvironmentModifications\r\n    ```\r\n\r\nThis should make it easier/faster to do unit tests and scripting with spack, without the cli interface.\r\n\r\n",
