    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\n\nOriginally reported by @haampie on Slack.\r\n\r\nWhen setting:\r\n```yaml\r\nconfig:\r\n  url_fetch_method: curl\r\n```\r\nThe use of `curl` is not honored if installing a binary package. In that case this portion of the code:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/blob/5208fcf1ea135b4500c38fbc7dba44e8558994bd/lib/spack/spack/binary_distribution.py#L444-L453\r\n\r\nis unconditionally using `urllib`. We should probably have some common API implemented both based on `urllib` and `curl` and dispatch to the one selected by the user.\n\n### Error message\n\nThe error message is not important here. What is important though is that if, for any reason, `urlib` needs to be avoided then installing from the buildcache will still use it to retrieve the index files.\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-1070-5208fcf1ea\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.10\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-icelake\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
