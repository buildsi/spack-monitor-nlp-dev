    "body": "[The fix](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/17986) for the small buglet addressed by `misc-cgo-testcshared.patch` has been merged into the tree a while back.  I was surprised to see that it wasn't in 1.7.5 and did a bit of digging.  It is *has not* been merged into the 1.7 branch but it *has* been merged into 1.8 (and therefor the patch will no longer be necessary).\r\n\r\nFigured I'd document my digging for the next person to come along.",
