    "body": "This PR adds the ability to tag methods with a string using the `@tag()` directive.  Tags are additive so more than one tag can be added to a method. \r\n\r\nThe initial use case is to add test-related tags to methods and outputting that information using `spack info`.  For example:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack info py-horovod\r\nPythonPackage:   py-horovod\r\n\r\nDescription:\r\n    Horovod is a distributed deep learning training framework for\r\n    TensorFlow, Keras, PyTorch, and Apache MXNet.\r\n\r\nHomepage: https://github.com/horovod\r\n\r\nMaintainers: @adamjstewart @aweits @tgaddair\r\n\r\nExternally Detectable: \r\n    False\r\n\r\nTags: \r\n    None\r\n\r\n[..snip..]\r\n\r\nVirtual Packages: \r\n    None\r\n\r\nTagged Methods: \r\n    sanity-checks:\r\n        PackageBase.sanity_check_prefix  PythonPackage.test\r\n\r\n    install-checks:\r\n        PackageBase.sanity_check_prefix\r\n\r\n    functional-checks:\r\n        PyHorovod.test\r\n\r\n    stand-alone-test:\r\n        PackageBase.test\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote in the example above that the `test` method is flagged as a `stand-alone-test` in `PackageBase` (thought the method is a hook with no added functionality), `sanity-checks` in `PythonPackage` (because PythonPackage performs import checks), and `functional-checks` in `PyHorovod` (since the code added to the package performs functional tests).\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Resolve `TypeError: 'list' object is not callable` issues for some packages (e.g., `parsec`, `upcxx`) and affecting style checks\r\n- [x] Make first pass over tagging test-related methods\r\n- [x] Move tag extraction to `package.py` for re-use\r\n- [ ] Add unit tests (as needed)",
