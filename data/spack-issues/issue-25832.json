Forcing a LDFLAGS=\"-L/path/to/libunwind -lunwind' bypasses the issue but it's an ugly solution. gperftools has cmake build now and we should switch the package to cmake build\r\n@albestro  @eschnett  @msimberg  @teonnik\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
