    "body": "Spack can be configured to avoid generating module files for implicitly installed products (i.e. dependencies which have been installed automatically):\r\n```yaml\r\nmodules:\r\n  tcl:\r\n    blacklist_implicits: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nHowever there is a bug in this feature which prevents the module files to be created during `spack install` for explicitly installed products. If a refresh is later triggered with `spack module tcl refresh`, the module file is correctly generated.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install zlib@1.2.11\r\n...\r\n$ module avail zlib\r\n$ spack module tcl refresh -y zlib\r\n...\r\n$ module avail zlib\r\nzlib/1.2.11\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Technical info on the issue\r\n\r\nAs far as I can tell the problem is caused by an incorrect order of operations in this part of the code:\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/blob/0bff0c2d0d99e49dad723acad3ea37172972edaf/lib/spack/spack/package.py#L1674-L1685\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the module file generation is triggered in the `build_process` function before the product is actually registered in the DB:\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/blob/0bff0c2d0d99e49dad723acad3ea37172972edaf/lib/spack/spack/package.py#L1633-L1634\r\n\r\nI would have happily contributed a fix for this issue but I feel like it might be non-trivial. The hooks must run before the staging folder is destroyed and I am not sure whether the registration in the DB can happen in the forked subprocess.",
