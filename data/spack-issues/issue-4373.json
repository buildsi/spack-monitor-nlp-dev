    "body": "For short-hand version specifications such as\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack install openmpi@2\r\n```\r\n\r\nthe *newest 2.x.y* release is not selected. Instead a warning of the following form is thrown:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Warning: There is no checksum on file to fetch openmpi@2 safely.\r\n==> Error: FetchError: Will not fetch openmpi@2\r\n    Add a checksum or use --no-checksum to skip this check.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFor writing an install recipe, e.g. to partition a docker image, I would find this helpful. Expending automatically to the latest known concrete version allows expressing \"install latest of the selected major and minor version if new patch level fixes are available\" but I will not blindly install \"the latest version\" as with `spack install openmpi` since such might break the API compatibility.\r\n\r\nDid I miss the syntax for that? Of course, there is always `openmpi@2+:2.999`, right? ;)",
