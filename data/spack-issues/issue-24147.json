    "body": "Added version 1.1.13\r\n\r\nFixed versions for dependencies based on README.md for package\r\nIn particular:\r\n   * versions 1.1.x require python@3, at least 3.4 and for 1.1.13 at least 3.6\r\n   * py-osqp had been pinned to version 0.4.1, but README.md either shows\r\n        no version restriction, of 0.4.1 and higher\r\n   * @1.1.13 requires at least 1.1.6 of py-scs\r\n   * I am assuming since 1.1.x is python@3 only, py-six no longer required\r\n        (it was not explicitly showing up in README.md for these versions)",
