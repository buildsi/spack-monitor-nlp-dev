    "body": "Some packages save the path to the compiler executable used during the build because they need to call the compiler again at run-time; the CFD solver [Code_Saturne](https://code-saturne.org/) does this for example. At present, the package will pick up the Spack compiler wrapper at build time and crash at run-time because the Spack compiler wrapper is called instead of the actual compiler.\r\n\r\nThe goal of this feature request is to replace the path to the Spack compiler wrapper with the path to the compiler executable in a plain-text file of a package.\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n  - commit `0.16.2-3327-ba35e9ea16`, this is an unpublished commit adding a Code_Saturne build to Spack; the branch is based on commit 69d69cbc798356a014a992609928cf9e66480297\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n  -  #21566 but this issue has been unresolved for about five months\r\n- Based on the wording of [Adam J. Stewart's post](https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/21566#issuecomment-776149989), I assume this feature is best implemented for all packages in Spack and not on a per-package basis. Please let me know if this is not true.\r\n\r\n**I am willing to implement this** given\r\n* someone telling me how to do this, and\r\n* acceptance criteria for a successful pull request.",
