This file is already integrated in Spack, we're just making a PR so that it can be commented on.\n\nSee the [package.py](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/petsc/package.py) file in the mainline `develop` branch to see blame for particular lines of code. This can be informative, because you can see the commits the code came from and why it's there.\n",
