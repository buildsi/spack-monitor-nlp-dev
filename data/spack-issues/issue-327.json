    "body": "I ran Spack on a particular modern workstation, and realized that it was calling make as `make -j40`. The system has 20 cores and hyperthreading enabled, so I see where the number `40` is coming from. However, I think it is too large.\n\nThere should be an option to set a machine-specific default for the maximum amount of parallelism, e.g. an option in `.spack`.\n",
