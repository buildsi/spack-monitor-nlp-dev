    "body": "Fixes #17891 \r\n\r\nThis PR updates the home page to a valid link, removes the unneeded URL, and provides a meaningful error message.  The \"fix\" is based on the example set by the `lustre` package for addressing an attempt to install a package that needs to be configured as being external.  \r\n\r\nOutput before the fix:\r\n```\r\n==> Warning: Missing a source id for cray-libsci@18.11.1.2\r\n==> Error: Unable to parse extension from http://www.nersc.gov/users/software/programming-libraries/math-libraries/libsci/.\r\n\r\nIf this URL is for a tarball but does not include the file extension\r\nin the name, you can explicitly declare it with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n    version('1.2.3', 'hash', extension='tar.gz')\r\n\r\nIf this URL is for a download like a .jar or .whl that does not need\r\nto be expanded, or an uncompressed installation script, you can tell\r\nSpack not to expand it with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n    version('1.2.3', 'hash', expand=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOutput with the fix in this PR:\r\n```\r\n==> Warning: Missing a source id for cray-libsci@18.11.1.2\r\n==> Installing cray-libsci\r\n==> No binary for cray-libsci found: installing from source\r\n==> cray-libsci: Executing phase: 'install'\r\n==> Error: InstallError: cray-libsci is not installable, you need to specify it as an external package in packages.yaml\r\n\r\n/g/g21/dahlgren/spack/clean/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/cray-libsci/package.py:81, in install:\r\n         79    def install(self, spec, prefix):\r\n         80        raise InstallError(\r\n  >>     81            self.spec.format('{name} is not installable, you need to specify '\r\n         82                             'it as an external package in packages.yaml'))\r\n\r\nSee build log for details:\r\n $TMPDIR/spack-stage/spack-stage-cray-libsci-18.11.1.2-5momk4bz2owdilzhqw76nsnkftpnpglc/spack-build-out.txt\r\n```",
