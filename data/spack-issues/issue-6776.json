Choose the right command for your shell.\r\n  \r\n  For bash and zsh:\r\n      . /Users/Adam/spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh\r\n  \r\n  For csh and tcsh:\r\n      setenv SPACK_ROOT /Users/Adam/spack\r\n      source /Users/Adam/spack/share/spack/setup-env.csh\r\n  \r\n  This exposes a 'spack' shell function, which you can use like\r\n      $ spack load package-foo\r\n  \r\n  Running the Spack executable directly (for example, invoking\r\n  ./bin/spack) will bypass the shell function and print this\r\n  placeholder message, even if you have sourced one of the above\r\n  shell integration scripts.\r\n```\r\n\r\nNo one else noticed this because they probably use Spack's shell integration.",
