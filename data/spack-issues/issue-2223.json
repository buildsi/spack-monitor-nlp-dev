    "body": "Would be good to have a per-package setting for `--run-tests`  and `--keep-stage` in `packages.yaml`. \r\n\r\nSay if I build a huge graph, but care about running small tests only for a few packages, i could add\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n  all:\r\n    run-tests: false\r\n    keep-stage: false\r\n  petsc:\r\n    run-tests: true\r\n    keep-stage: false\r\n  dealii:\r\n    run-tests: true\r\n    keep-stage: true\r\n```\r\n\r\nps. CLI would still take precedence to settings in `packages.yaml`.",
