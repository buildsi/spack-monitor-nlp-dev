    "body": "As a maintainer of Spack I want to have a CI workflow that automatically detects which are the pull requests that modify Spack's core so that I can request a more thorough testing only for them.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nRecently we have experienced slow-downs with our CI when receiving a large number of PRs on the same day. The major bottleneck was the availability of a MacOS worker on Travis CI.  \r\n\r\nMost of the PRs  were just proposing minimal modifications to packages, so for them a MacOS worker was unnecessary. The rationale here is to identify automatically which are the PRs that need more thorough testing and require more resources only for them.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt seems that Github actions might help with this with their [filtering](https://help.github.com/en/github/automating-your-workflow-with-github-actions/configuring-a-workflow#filtering-for-specific-branches-tags-and-paths) capabilities that permit to filter on the paths that have been modified in a PR. We might then shape our workflow depending on the parts that are effectively modified.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nRelated effort is #5842. It's more demanding on contributors since the workflows are static and based on the name of the branch.",
