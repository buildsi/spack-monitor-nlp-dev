    "body": "looking at `spack list` most of the packages are named `name1-name2`. \nThere are couple of exceptions: `SuiteSparse`, `SAMRAI`, `the_silver_searcher` and `R`. I guess `R` should really stay as an exception, but I don't see any reason why you shouldn't use `suite-sparse`, `samrai` and `the-silver-searcher` instead.\n",
