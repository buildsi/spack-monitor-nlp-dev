    "body": "# Singularity Desktop for macOS \r\n\r\nSince Spack supports builds on macOS, Singularity now offers a macOS release (Beta Release) allows Linux-based Singularity containers to be designed, built, tested, and signed/verified on macOS. This capability is enabled through two components:\r\n\r\n- Singularity itself - a native port of the software to macOS that offers a subset of the functionality currently available under Linux\r\n- The macOS compatibility layer - a pre-built package that provides a binary interface between Singularity and macOS\r\n\r\nMore info about the macOS implementation can be found at:\r\n- https://sylabs.io/singularity-desktop-macos/\r\n\r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!",
