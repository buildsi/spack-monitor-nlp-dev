    "body": "It looks like ~55 packages reference glob (grep matches anyways).\r\n\r\nI was surprised to discover glob.glob('foo*.{a,so,dylib}') is not a valid Python glob. \r\n\r\nPython glob doesn't support bash-style brace expansion. But, there is a [python package](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/braceexpand) that supports it.\r\n\r\nMight be helpful to package.py writers to have a glob that works more or less like bash's file globbing by adding a Spack defined glob function (kinda like join_path).\r\n",
