    "body": "The problem: In many cases, it is desirable to use the system's OpenSSL, rather than compiling your own.  Spack needs a way to make this happen.  Possible solution:\n\n> Make a variant of the OpenSSL package, maybe called \"+system\". This variant would \"do nothing\" in the install method, except create one file or directory in the install directory to acquiesce Spack.\n\nBut... what if this same behavior is desired for other packages as well?  Maybe we should make \"+system\" be a variant that can be applied to ANY package (by hacking class Package).\n",
