    "body": "Spack currently cannot run as a background process uninterrupted because some of the logging functions used in the install method (especially to create the dynamic verbosity toggle with the `v` key) cause the OS to issue a `SIGTTOU` to Spack when it's backgrounded.\r\n\r\nThis PR puts the necessary gatekeeping in place so that Spack doesn't do anything that will cause a signal to stop the process when operating as a background process.",
