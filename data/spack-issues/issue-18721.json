    "body": "Prior to this PR, the descriptions for `spack test` subcommands were not being displayed.  The reason they were missing is because they were being provided in the `help`, not `description` argument.\r\n\r\nFor example, `spack test list --help` output was:\r\n```\r\nusage: spack test list [-h] ...\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  filter      optional case-insensitive glob patterns to filter results.\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\r\n```\r\n\r\nand is now:\r\n```\r\nusage: spack test list [-h] ...\r\n\r\nList all installed packages with available tests.\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  filter      optional case-insensitive glob patterns to filter results.\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help  show this help message and exit\r\n```",
