This requires us to use `python -S` as an interpreter, instead of plain `python`.\r\n\r\nOf course things can't be that simple. In Linux (but not in BSD or MacOS) the shebang pass a single string argument to the interpreter. More details on the subject are here:\r\n\r\n- http://sambal.org/2014/02/passing-options-node-shebang-line/\r\n- https://github.com/smikes/node/blob/minus-x-switch/doc/Minus-X-Switch-Proposal.md#shebang-interpretation\r\n\r\nbut the bottom line is that this requires us to have a wrapper bash script that invokes the interpreter with the correct option.\r\n\r\nFinally, as now we are not picking up anything from the 'site', we need to vendor `setuptools` (which was still missing).",
