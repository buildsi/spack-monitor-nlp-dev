    "body": "### Description\r\n\r\nWe currently have binary mirrors for the MVAPICH2-X and MVAPICH2-GDR packages that are available through spack. The binaries on these mirrors are rendered unusable whenever the build dependencies of MVAPICH2-X or MVPICH2-GDR (bison and libpciaccess) are updated by their maintainers. \r\n\r\nThis causes us to regenerate all our binaries with the latest version of spack and all the dependencies.\r\n\r\n### Ask\r\n\r\nIs there a way around this? Given the number of variants we have, we generate many combinations of binaries. It is very cumbersome to figure out when our binaries are no longer accessible by users and to regenerate them.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install mvapich2-gdr (does not work anymore. binaries not found though it exists.)\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
