    "body": "TBB is an optional dependency of deal.II, used by the library to parallelize some operations with threads. If the cmake flag DEAL_II_WITH_THREADS (default: ON) is set to OFF, deal.II does not require TBB anymore. This pull request adds a variant 'threads' to the deal.II package with the same default behavior (+threads), which controls the TBB dependency.\r\n\r\nThe motivation for this pull request is that there is currently a bug in the Intel compiler (icpc version 19.0.3.199 (gcc version 8.3.0 compatibility)), that makes it impossible to compile deal.II with thread support enabled (a reference to one of the headers in TBB fires a \"bad pointer\" internal error in icpc). So without this variant, I could not build deal.II.",
