    "body": "[UPDATE]\r\nRevamped this PR to base on the latest repository. The choice of compiler flags are based on ELPA's [wiki page](https://gitlab.mpcdf.mpg.de/elpa/elpa/wikis/INSTALL) (apart from `-funsafe-math-optimizations` and architecture-specific settings). Tested working on the latest five versions of this package using both GCC and Intel.\r\n\r\nSetting `SCALAPACK_LDFLAGS` in the build environment does not seem to be sufficient for Intel, so I have it (along with two other dependencies) passed to the `configure` script per its INSTALL instructions.\r\n\r\n---\r\nTentative fix for issues with GCC 6.4.0/7.2.0 (#6143) and Intel 2018.0 (#6144). Before, in the second call to `setup_environment()`, `spec['mpi'].mpicc` somehow became undefined.\r\n  \r\n  \r\n  ",
