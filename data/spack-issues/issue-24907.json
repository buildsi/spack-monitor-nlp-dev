    "body": "It would be useful to be able to match specs by glob/wildcard in some contexts.  For example, you could easily create a view with all python packages (`select: py-*`), or change the projection for R packages (`r-*: R/{name}/{version}`), or uninstall `intel-oneapi-*`.\r\n\r\nThis is less a PR and more a feature request with a proof-of-concept implementation. This simple change works fine for the basic case, but doesn't cover namespaces properly and allows `*` some places it probably shouldn't be. It might also be nice to allow full globs (`?[]`).\r\n\r\nIf this seems useful, I'm happy to work this into a full implementation with some guidance, including proper checks, tests, and documenation.",
