    "body": "I also added a `url_for_version()` function to make it easier to add versions in the future. I was trying to find a way to switch version numbers like `composer.2016.3` to `2016.3.composer` for proper version comparison, but we rely on that ordering for `spec.satisfies`, so I gave up.\n\nThe only problem I'm having installing 2017 is the following error message:\n\n```\n'./install.sh' '--silent' 'silent.cfg'\nCOMPONENTS parameter in silent configuration file contains invalid values:\nintel-icsxe-pset\n```\n\nThat tag is indeed in `pset/mediaconfig.xml` so I'm not sure how to prevent this. I could try patching the file to remove that section? Or I could add a special filter when determining components? Not sure why that tag is present in the first place if it's invalid. Anyway, building with `+all` prevents this problem\n",
