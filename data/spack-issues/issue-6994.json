    "body": "This PR marks the slowest unit tests in our suite, so if you run:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack test -m \"not slowtest\"\r\n```\r\nyou'll deselect them. On my laptop this runs in ~70 sec. instead of ~230 sec. for the full suite. Can be quite useful to integrate testing in development workflow (for instance having the IDE running  `spack test -m \"not slowtest\"` for you in the background).\r\n\r\n@nazavode ",
