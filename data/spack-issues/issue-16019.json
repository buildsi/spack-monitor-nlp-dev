    "body": "Mathematica installer moves all files and directories from installation directory to a backup one. The problem is that it also moves .spack to this backup location. Once it's done it does not move .spack back where it was.\r\n\r\nMy patch creates a copy of .spack to /tmp then moves it back right before exiting the install call.",
