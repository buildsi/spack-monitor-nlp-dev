    "body": "Fixes #10318 \r\n\r\nI wasn't actually able to reproduce #10318 on my macOS 10.14.2 using APFS, and these files have existed for over 3 years (#1288 and #1335), so I'm shocked that @paul-hammant had a problem. But I don't think these symlinks are actually necessary, since we add `lib/spack/env/case-insensitive` to the `PATH` as well.",
