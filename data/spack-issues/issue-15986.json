    "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI noticed that Octave package installation in macOS is possible with spack, so I thought it would be interesting to add that possibility to the wiki page:\r\n\r\nhttps://wiki.octave.org/Octave_for_macOS\r\n\r\nI left there a draft and I would like to ask you if you want to check it out and correct / update what I wrote.\r\n\r\nps: If you have a working version of Octave in macOS Catalina installed via spack, you can share that information, so that other users can know all working versions.\r\n\r\nCheers",
