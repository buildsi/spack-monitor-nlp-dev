Although \"+cuda\" is used as the spack argument, CUDA is off for Kokkos:\r\n```\r\n-DKokkos_ENABLE_CUDA=OFF\r\n```\r\nAs a result, the compiled LAMMPS cannot use Kokkos for GPUs.\n\n### General information\n\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
