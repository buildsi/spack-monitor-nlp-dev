    "body": "When I try to build the docs with the latest version of Sphinx, I see the following deprecation warning:\r\n```\r\n/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/docs/conf.py:94: RemovedInSphinx30Warning: app.override_domain() is deprecated. Use app.add_domain() with override option instead.\r\n  sphinx.override_domain(PatchedPythonDomain)\r\n```\r\nThis PR fixes that. It also sets the minimum required version of Sphinx to 1.8, which is the version where the `override` option was added to `add_domain()`: https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/extdev/appapi.html#sphinx.application.Sphinx.add_domain",
