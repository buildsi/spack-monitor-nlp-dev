    "body": "Borrowing from [Douglas Adams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Douglas_Adams)....\r\n\r\nThe gig for which I've been using Spack is ending this coming Monday.  I'll no longer have access to those systems or be (directly) involved in solving their problems.  Hopefully they'll continue with it and be able to contribute to the public project.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what's next for me and/or whether Spack will be applicable.  Either way, I might try to peel off a project or two to practice my Python.\r\n\r\nBut, I probably won't be following the project as closely as I have been so I wanted to give folks a heads up.\r\n\r\nI **REALLY** appreciate all of the help all y'all have given me since I stumbled in the front door.",
