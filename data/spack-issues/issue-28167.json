    "body": "This PR adds a bunch of new versions to the py-blessed package.\r\n\r\nNote that this package's requirements.txt file contains the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\nwcwidth>=0.1.4\r\nsix>=1.9.0\r\n# support python2.6 by using backport of 'orderedict'\r\nordereddict==1.1; python_version < \"2.7\"\r\n# support python2.7 by using backport of 'functools.lru_cache'\r\nbackports.functools-lru-cache>=1.2.1; python_version < \"3.2\"\r\n# Windows requires jinxed\r\njinxed>=1.1.0; platform_system == \"Windows\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n(version 1.15.0 only had the first 2 lines). The ordereddict dependency is only for python 2.6, and backports.functools-lru-cache is for python 2.7, both of which are deprecated, so I didn't bother adding these dependencies.\r\nI'm not sure how to handle the jinxed dependency when the platform is windows. I don't have a Windows to test on (and jinxed is not available in spack yet).",
