I think that would be a great way to notify users that a new package was installed.\r\n\r\nThis could be done by wrapping Spack into an Ansible role, or some other configuration management tool that has Slack integration, though checking here to see if anyone has other ideas.\r\n\r\nTwitter would be cool, too!",
