    "body": "I found that tarballs created with a non-default directory layout cannot be relocated to a default directory layout. In this case replacing the old layout root with the new layout root does not work. The rpaths with still refer to the non-default relative prefixes.\r\n\r\nAny replacement or rpaths happens in a workdir before moving the files to the install prefix. This prevents having a broken install prefix left over since I did not clean up on exceptions.\r\n\r\nUsed tempfile.mkdtemp where possible to avoid creating random directories in cwd if -d options is not used with buildcache create and install.\r\n\r\nMoved the exception handling as done in #6344 with the messages changed to be generic enough to use with spack install --use-cache  and spack buildcache. \r\n",
