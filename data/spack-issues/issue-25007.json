    "body": "z3 is a dependency of llvm and llvm-amdgpu, and when z3 python bindings\nare enabled it depends on py-setuptools as a run dependency. That's\nfine, except that py-setuptools now influences the hash of\nllvm/llvm-amdgpu, which can be very annoying when another package\nrestricts the py-setuptools version -- you'll end up recompiling llvm\nfor no good reason :(.\n",
