    "body": "Currently there is no way to get the output of `spack concretize` on a concrete environment other than `spack concretize -f` and praying you haven't bumped spack since last time. There is `spack find`, but that requires installing the environment first.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `spack spec` environment-aware in the sense that when no specs are provided and there's an active env, it concretizes the env (which is a no-op for concrete environments) and effectively runs `spack spec [root specs]`.\r\n\r\nThe output shows pairs of [user input spec from env] + [concrete output spec].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
