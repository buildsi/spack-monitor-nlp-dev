    "body": "A configure script might want to check the presence of a linker by requesting its version. The GNU linker ignores -rpath arguments if -v argument is given. This is not the case for Xcode (MacOS) linker, for example. The latter outputs its version and tries to process the rest of the arguments, which leads to a non-zero exit status because of the rpathes appended by the Spack's wrapper.",
