    "body": "I've set up an environment file, to share with my team so that we can all install from the same versions etc. One of these packages requires linking to OpenSSL during build (and thus needs `ldflags` to be set correctly). Inside the environment file, I don't actually know the path OpenSSL will be installed into.\r\n\r\nIs there some way to handle this? It might be that I'm doing something wrong anyway, so any guidance is appreciated. Maybe the spec for this package should be setting those arguments itself?",
