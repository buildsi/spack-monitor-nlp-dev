    "body": "Notes for @tldahlgren for future improvements to the testing system:\r\n- It was surprising behavior to me that `self.run_tests('swig', installed=True, ...` did *not* work since the documentation reads  as though the search for the `swig` exe should consider the package's install prefix. I think the HDF5 smoke tests need to be fixed since they also use this option (and they might be silently failing because they also pass `skip_missing=True`).\r\n- A non-fatal assertion `self.check_test_result(assertion, msg)` (or similar) would be good to encapsulate `self.test_failures`.\r\n- To avoid overcomplicating the `Package` class even further, maybe a `PackageTest` class instance could be passed as part of the `test` call, so testing methods like `run_test` and `assert_equal` would get added to that helper class.",
