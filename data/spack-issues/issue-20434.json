I simply want to report the deprecation warning.**\r\n\r\nI wrote a spack-python script to do some cleanup/setup of spack files in between runs. I wrote a few unittests for my script, and when I ran them, I got these deprecation warnings:\r\n\r\n```\r\ntests/test_cleanup.py::test_SpackCleanup::test_compiler_find\r\n

reproduce the issue\r\nThe script is rather long, so I'll give you a piece of it:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef spack_compiler_find():\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    Enable spack to find compilers.\r\n\r\n    \"\"\"\r\n    from spack.main import SpackCommand\r\n    compiler = SpackCommand('compiler')\r\n    compiler('find')\r\n    logger.info(\"'spack compiler find' has been triggered.\")\r\n```\r\nThe test:\r\n```\r\nimport unittest\r\nfrom .cleanup import spack_compiler_find\r\nimport os\r\nimport shutil\r\n\r\nclass test_SpackCleanup(unittest.TestCase):\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def setUpClass(cls):\r\n        if not os.path.isdir(os.path.expanduser('~/.spack')):\r\n            os.mkdir(os.path.expanduser('~/.spack'))\r\n\r\n    @classmethod\r\n    def tearDownClass(cls):\r\n        if os.path.isdir(os.path.expanduser('~/.spack')):\r\n            shutil.rmtree(os.path.expanduser('~/.spack'))\r\n\r\n    def test_compiler_find(self):\r\n        spack_compiler_find()\r\n        self.assertTrue(os.path.isdir(os.path.expanduser('~/.spack')))\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n```\r\ntests/test_cleanup.py::test_SpackCleanup::test_compiler_find\r\n
