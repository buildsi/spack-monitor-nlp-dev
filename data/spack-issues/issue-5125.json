    "body": "The `spack buildcache` command was added a couple days ago in #4854, but there were a couple things missing:\r\n\r\n1. Forgot to update the tab completion script with the new command\r\n2. Docs didn't format well: http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/binary_caches.html\r\n\r\nThis PR adds tab completion and updates the docs to fit better with the rest of our documentation.\r\n\r\n@gartung Can you see if these changes look good to you?",
