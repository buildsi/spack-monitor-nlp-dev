    "body": "Adds package file for https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx-local.\r\n\r\nAs there is no release yet, I'm not adding this as a dependency to HPX yet. At the next release HPX will get an update to use this as a dependency.\r\n\r\n@teonnik, @albestro I've added (kept) you two as maintainers. Are you ok with that?\r\n\r\nNote that two major options compared to HPX are \"missing\":\r\n- `max_cpu_count`: because of https://github.com/STEllAR-GROUP/hpx/pull/5663 this should not be necessary by default, so I'm leaving it out for now. If there ends up being a need for it again we can add it back.\r\n- All the `tools` variants are temporarily gone. These will need to be added back, but I will do so separately.",
