    "body": "Extracts error messages from the implementation of `buildcache.py` and moves them to the exception itself. Otherwise, using `spack install --use-cache` may hit an exception without reporting any error message. Example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack install --use-cache python\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt tries to install python from binaries, if no gpg key was used it raises a `NoVerificationException` and the user just getsan error message without description: `==> Error: `\r\n\r\nThis PR avoids to handle these exceptions also when using `--use-cache` during the `install` command and makes them consistent with the rest of exceptions.\r\n\r\n@gartung",
