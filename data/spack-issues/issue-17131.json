    "body": "`arpack-ng` is currently not building with gcc10. This is already fixed upstream, but there is no new release yet ( see this issue: https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng/issues/261 for example).  \r\nI create a patch based on these two commits:\r\n  - https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng/commit/9418632214acf6d387896ab29a8f5bdff2d4e38a\r\n  - https://github.com/opencollab/arpack-ng/commit/ad82dcbc0beeed5616e2d5a28a089d9785f8b8b8\r\n\r\nThis works for me ( archlinux, gcc 10.1.0) and patch applies for 3.7.0, 3.6.3 and 3.6.2.",
