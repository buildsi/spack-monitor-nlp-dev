    "body": "Consider the following sequence of commands:\n\n```\nspack install --keep-stage pism\nspack uninstall pism\nspack install --keep-stage pism\n```\n\nInside pism/package.py's install(), I have the following code:\n\n```\n       options = self.config_args(spec, prefix) + spack.build_environment.get_std_cmake_args(self)\n\n        build_directory = join_path(self.stage.path, 'spack-build')\n        source_directory = self.stage.source_path\n        with working_dir(build_directory, create=True):\n            print 'CMAKE', source_directory, options\n```\n\nThe output of the  CMAKE print statement is different on the two runs.  On the first run, I get (correct):\n\n```\n     CMAKE /home/rpfische/spack/var/spack/stage/pism-88beceba-4lpev66u7qe7p7c6rbsvsz4sbskjknv5/pism-pism-88beceb\n```\n\nOn the second run, I get (incorrect):\n\n```\n     CMAKE /home/rpfische/spack/var/spack/stage/pism-88beceba-4lpev66u7qe7p7c6rbsvsz4sbskjknv5/spack-build\n```\n",
