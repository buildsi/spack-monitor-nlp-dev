    "body": "We recently added `spack style`, which runs `mypy`, but we weren't ignoring the `.mypy_cache` directory. We also weren't ignoring the debug logs created by `spack debug create-db-tarball`. This PR includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add all ignores from https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore (includes mypy)\r\n- [x] Ignore file created by `spack debug create-db-tarball`\r\n- [x] Remove ignores for ancient versions of Spack (dotkit)\r\n\r\nLet me know if any of the weird things like `/db`, `/etc/spackconfig`, or `/bin/spackc` were there for a reason.\r\n\r\nFixes #20798",
