    "body": "Even though Spack can restrict privileges on installed packages, by default all of the source files it caches (even for those same packages!) are world-readable. I use Spack on institutional clusters to install software that requires special licenses to access (private git repositories), so I need to ensure that non-licensed users cannot access the source code.\r\n\r\nPerhaps as a starting point, the cache files could by default be non-readable for group/other?\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n- Add a restrictive `permissions` entry to a package in `packages.yaml`\r\n- Install that package with `spack install`\r\n\r\n",
