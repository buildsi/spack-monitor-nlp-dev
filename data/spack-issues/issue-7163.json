This failed when installing gmp.\r\n\r\nIt failed with the following error:\r\n```\r\nError: ProcessError: /Users/<username>/Software/spack/opt/spack/darwin-highsierra-x86_64/clang-9.0.0-apple/libtool-2.4.6-yjjy7rl7ow76cixrcfwg7bdqvmc3wmy6/bin/libtoolize: No such file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\nChecking the path above, I found a tool ```glibtoolize``` inside the ```bin``` folder.\r\nThe issue was solved by adding a symolic link from glibtoolize to libtoolize. However, that seems to me like an odd workaround.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install gcc@7.3.0 +piclibs\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
