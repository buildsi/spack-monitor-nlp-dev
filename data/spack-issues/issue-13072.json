    "body": "Scenario:\r\n\r\n- Frontend node arch is `linux-centos7-zen`. \r\n- Some compute nodes are on `linux-centos7-x86_64`\r\n\r\nWhen building formula `r` on the frontend using `target=x86_64` (to get it running on the computes) everything builds. However, when trying to build the same formula directly on the computes (which the spack dir shared via NFS to the nodes) I get\r\n\r\n```sh\r\n     51    checking for gcc... /opt/spack/lib/spack/env/gcc/gcc\r\n     52    checking whether the C compiler works... no\r\n  >> 53    configure: error: in `/tmp/patrick/r-3.6.1-wjtv4kc2vxt4vtdwxjgab4er6wfnfsbv/spack-src':\r\n  >> 54    configure: error: C compiler cannot create executables\r\n     55    See `config.log' for more details\r\n```\r\n\r\n- [build log](https://transfer.sh/O0q25/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n- I'm on c8c795e7dbde22dc47c9ae285a4dd59004b115b1 \r\n- On the \"frontend\" I do `spack install r target=x86_64`\r\n- On the node I do `spack install r` (defaults to arch=x86_64)\r\n\r\n#### Why do I want to build the formula on the computes directly?\r\nCurrently when loading the x86_64 env module (which was built on the frontend) and executing the binary on the computes, I receive segfaults on the computes. I wanted to see if building the formula directly on the computes might solves this due to \"better\" support for the arch and cpu of the computes.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
