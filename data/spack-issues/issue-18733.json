    "body": "### Description\r\nWe are trying to build ocaml based software CCA/EBT(https://github.com/ebt-hpc/cca) in Spack.\r\nCCA/EBT needs `ocamlfind` to build.\r\nhttps://opam.ocaml.org/packages/ocamlfind/\r\n`ocamlfind` works same as `pip`. `ocamlfind` must be installed in `ocaml` directory and\r\n`ocamlfind` make library files under `ocaml`.\r\nThis behavior seems to conflict Spack management system.\r\nShould we import `ocamlfind` buildsystem in Spack as pip?\r\nI don't know about ocaml itself. This import seems very difficult.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
