    "body": "I'm on a Debian 10 machine, which has python 2.7.16 installed in system directories.\r\nI have installed Python 3.7.4 through Spack. As soon as I load this package (or if it is loaded as part of a `spack load -r` of another package) the next spack commands I issue fail. For example, `spack load` gives me `==> Error: Unknown command: module` (even though the module command is available on the command line). `spack` gives me a Python stack trace leading up to `ModuleNotFoundError: No module named '_ssl'`.\r\n\r\nI have seen this happen also on Theta, with different error messages.\r\n\r\nMaybe the fix would be to use some environment variables that, if set, specifies which Python (and Python home) should be used to execute spack, regardless of whether another Python is loaded.\r\n\r\n",
