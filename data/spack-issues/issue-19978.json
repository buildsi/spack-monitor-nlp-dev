    "body": "This PR fixes two problems with clang/llvm's version detection. clang's version output looks like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclang version 11.0.0\r\nTarget: x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis caused clang's version to be misdetected as:\r\n\r\n```\r\nclang@11.0.0\r\nTarget:\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis resulted in errors when trying to actually use it as a compiler.\r\n\r\nWhen using `spack external find`, we couldn't determine the compiler version, resulting in errors like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Warning: \"llvm@11.0.0+clang+lld+lldb\" has been detected on the system but will not be added to packages.yaml [reason=c compiler not found for llvm@11.0.0+clang+lld+lldb]\r\n```\r\n\r\nChanging the regex to only match until the end of the line fixes these problems.\r\n\r\nFixes: #19473",
