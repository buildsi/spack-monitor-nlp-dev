    "body": "Fixes a bug introduced by #27798. We previously ran:\r\n```console\r\n$ python setup.py build --mpicc=...\r\n$ python setup.py install\r\n```\r\nAfter #27798, we run `pip install`, which runs:\r\n```console\r\n$ python setup.py install --mpicc=...\r\n```\r\nAt least in older versions of mpi4py, the `--mpicc` flag is only valid for the build phase, not the install phase. In newer versions of mpi4py, the `--mpicc` flag doesn't seem to break anything, but it's also unclear if it's actually being used.\r\n\r\nIt looks like this flag was added by @TiffanyAnn in #12191, maybe she can investigate.\r\n\r\nFixes #28748",
