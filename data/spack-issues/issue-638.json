    "body": "Add information to the documentation.  Common setups that need documentation so far are:\n1. GNU compilers\n1. Intel compilers\n1. PGI compilers\n1. Mixed compilers (particularly Clang+GNU on Macintosh)\n\n@adamjstewart:\n\n> Documenation issue:\n> There currently isn't much documentation on setting up compilers. You may have noticed on GitHub and the Google Group that a lot of people are having problems getting the Intel compilers to work with Spack. There are dozens of suggested workaround, and I've been meaning to add documentation for these. I would like an entire section on compilers, with specific instructions for each compiler. It could include instructions on installing PGI with Spack (see #558), workarounds for setting up Intel (see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/spack/NxyNTAZyMQg), and instructions for setting up mixed compilers.\n",
