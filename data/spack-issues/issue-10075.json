    "body": "Fixes #9729.\r\n\r\nI took the patch from https://savannah.nongnu.org/bugs/index.php?54967, generated a new `configure` script, and produced a new patch of the relevant changes. This way, we don't need to add `m4`, `libtool`, `autoconf`, and `automake` dependencies needed by the previous patch.\r\n\r\nWith this patch, I was able to successfully install freetype with GCC 4.9.3 on Cray CNL5 (Blue Waters).\r\n\r\n@jrood-nrel ",
