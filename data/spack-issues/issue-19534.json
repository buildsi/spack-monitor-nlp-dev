    "body": "I wanted to suggest that all the applications that are installed through the `spack` package manager should be able to have their permissions restricted, such as file access ~ I can specify which directories can it access and which directories it can't access, create virtual directories for the application to access, microphone, speaker, bluetooth, Internet etc.\r\n\r\nAdditionally with `spack`,  I also wanted to suggest the ability to get applications that are either installed outside of `spack` (installed via `pacman` or something similar) or applications that there binaries are directly being launched, to configure it to run through `spack` and to restrict its permissions.",
