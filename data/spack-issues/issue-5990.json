    "body": "Netcdf was recently updated here. If I did `spack spec nalu`, I would get an unsatisfiable error in concretization. Trilinos was not adding the netcdf dependency correctly when using `trilinos+pnetcdf` after the 12.12.1 version showed up. This consolidates the netcdf dependency lines into one and now the netcdf dependency is correctly put into the spec when using `+pnetcdf` and the current default version 12.12.1 of trilinos.",
