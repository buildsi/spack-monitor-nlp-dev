    "body": "**Note this PR addresses a feature a user asked about when #13100 was under testing.**\r\n\r\nThe distributed build process automatically removes failure tracking information for relevant packages when ``spack install`` is executed.  This has been shown to cause problems with environment installations from ``spack.yaml`` files -- see #15415 -- that led to the need to optionally retain failure tracking.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the ability to explicitly remove install failure tracking data for a Spack instance through the `spack clean` command using either the `-f` or `-a` options.\r\n\r\nTODO\r\n------\r\n- [x] Add option to documentation\r\n\r\nFollow-On Work\r\n----------------\r\n- If #15415 is merged before this PR,  `packaging_guide.rst`'s discussion of `--keep-failures` should be changed to reference the `spack clean -f` option",
