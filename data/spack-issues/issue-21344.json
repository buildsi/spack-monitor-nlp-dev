    "body": "Tried to install Clingo on a Cray system (Blue Waters). Default compiler is gcc@6.3.0.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install clingo\r\n...[snip]...\r\n==> Installing clingo-master-7cfrbcc7vks2dbnzklogk5fpapsy7kof\r\n==> Warning: Spack will not check SSL certificates.

I can execute this step without the \"fix\" if desired.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --debug --stacktrace <command>\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<details>\r\n<summary><code>spack debug report</code></summary>\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-913-6b13909cc1\r\n* **Python:** 2.6.9\r\n* **Platform:** cray-suse_linux11-bulldozer\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n```\r\n\r\n</details>\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [ ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
