    "body": "I'm building a package (not in Spack yet) that depends on BLAS/LAPACK. When I build it with OpenBLAS and run `make test`, I see the following warning:\n\n```\nOpenBLAS Warning : Detect OpenMP Loop and this application may hang. Please rebuild the library with USE_OPENMP=1 option.\n```\n\nThis warning message continuously prints to `spack-build.out` until it eventually fills up the filesystem. Has anyone ever ran into this before? Is it safe to add `USE_OPENMP=1` to OpenBLAS or will that cause problems for others?\n",
