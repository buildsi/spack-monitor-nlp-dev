    "body": "Fixes #3727.\r\n\r\nI noticed some strange behavior when installing this package. If I run `spack install bash`, it works fine. If I run `spack install --run-tests bash`, the tests all pass, but after Spack prints the `[+] /path/to/bash` line, it hangs. Has anyone ever seen this before?",
