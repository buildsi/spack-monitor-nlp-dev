    "body": "This change adds a `--scope` flag to the `spack install` command. I am new to Spack and am not fully aware of the inner workings of the `config` module, so I think my current changes may cause nasty side effects. However, in summary, my current changes should simply remove all scopes except the specified one from the configuration so that the specified scope is the only one used, or else an error occurs.\r\n\r\nCloses #25547",
