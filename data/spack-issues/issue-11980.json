    "body": "On the latest develop, I tried uninstalling all of my packages, and Spack hung on an external `jdk` installation. It appears that Spack is unable to uninstall extendable packages (or any package that extends them) when that external package is installed in a directory the user does not have permission to access.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nAdd the following to `packages.yaml`:\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n    jdk:\r\n        paths:\r\n            jdk@10.0.1_10: /Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-10.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home\r\n        buildable: False\r\n```\r\nThen try to install and uninstall the package:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install commons-lang  # extends jdk\r\n$ spack uninstall commons-lang\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack -d uninstall commons-lang\r\n...\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/bin/spack\", line 48, in <module>\r\n    sys.exit(spack.main.main())\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/main.py\", line 697, in main\r\n    return _invoke_command(command, parser, args, unknown)\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/main.py\", line 447, in _invoke_command\r\n    return_val = command(parser, args)\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/cmd/uninstall.py\", line 336, in uninstall\r\n    args, spack.cmd.parse_specs(args.packages) if args.packages else [any])\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/cmd/uninstall.py\", line 326, in uninstall_specs\r\n    do_uninstall(env, uninstall_list, args.force)\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/cmd/uninstall.py\", line 224, in do_uninstall\r\n    item.do_uninstall(force=force)\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/package.py\", line 2017, in do_uninstall\r\n    Package.uninstall_by_spec(self.spec, force)\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/package.py\", line 1997, in uninstall_by_spec\r\n    spack.hooks.pre_uninstall(spec)\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/hooks/__init__.py\", line 54, in __call__\r\n    hook(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/hooks/extensions.py\", line 16, in pre_uninstall\r\n    view = YamlFilesystemView(target, spack.store.layout)\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/spack/filesystem_view.py\", line 204, in __init__\r\n    mkdirp(os.path.dirname(projections_path))\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/llnl/util/filesystem.py\", line 436, in mkdirp\r\n    raise e\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/spack/lib/spack/llnl/util/filesystem.py\", line 431, in mkdirp\r\n    os.makedirs(path)\r\n  File \"/Users/Adam/miniconda3/lib/python3.7/os.py\", line 221, in makedirs\r\n    mkdir(name, mode)\r\nPermissionError: [Errno 13] Permission denied: '/Library/Java/JavaVirtualMachines/jdk-10.0.1.jdk/Contents/Home/.spack'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis occurred on macOS Mojave 10.14.5.\r\n\r\nIt appears that this bug only occurs with extensions, and only when an extension is actually installed. This bug is not exclusive to `jdk`, it can be reproduced with other packages as well. For example, add `libsigsegv` to `packages.yaml` in a directory lacking permissions. Then edit `libsigsegv` to add `extendable = True`, and edit `m4` to add `extends('libsigsegv')`. Then run:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install m4  # extends libsigsegv\r\n$ spack uninstall m4\r\n```",
