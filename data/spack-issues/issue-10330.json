In fact, OpenSSL is desired/used by many Python versions, probably going back to Python2.  It is required to access anything SSL over the network; and is also required by Spack itself.  See here, for example, in my build log for `python@3.6` where it tried (an failed) to find/build appropriate SSL support:\r\n```\r\n...\r\nPython build finished successfully!\r\nThe necessary bits to build these optional modules were not found:\r\n_ssl                  ossaudiodev           spwd               \r\nTo find the necessary bits, look in setup.py in detect_modules() for the module's name.\r\n\r\nThe following modules found by detect_modules() in setup.py, have been\r\nbuilt by the Makefile instead, as configured by the Setup files:\r\natexit                pwd                   time               \r\n\r\nFailed to build these modules:\r\n_lzma                                                          \r\n\r\nrunning build_scripts\r\n...\r\n```\r\n",
