    "body": "The logic stated that SuperLU couldn't be in the same DAG as new CUDA (e.g. if it was linked against an MPI that had cuda enabled), but the conflict is only when cuda is enabled as a variant in superlu. This fixes #28609 .\r\n\r\nI also took the opportunity to simplify the cmake recipe using the CMakePackage helper functions.",
