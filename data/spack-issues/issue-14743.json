    "body": "*Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\n\r\nWhen creating a spack environment if I have an externally defined root such as cmake, it does not show up in the view that is subsequently created.  While it can be created in multiple ways, I encountered this with the PR https://github.com/LLNL/lbann/pull/1414.\r\n\r\nNote that @becker33 I gave you a spack.yaml file that has this problem.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack create env lbann-dev spack.yaml\r\n$ spack activate -p lbann-dev\r\n$ which cmake\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nThe output of \r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ which cmake\r\n```\r\n\r\npoints to the system cmake, not the externally defined cmake.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\n 1. LLNL LC Pascal\r\n 2. spack.yaml file given to @becker33 \r\n\r\n-----\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n",
