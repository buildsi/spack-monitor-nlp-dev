    "body": "There's a fair amount of cruft in the Spack core, and this the first of what will be ongoing attempts to clean a bunch of it up in advance of adding a new concretizer.  \r\n\r\nThe main user-facing changes here are:\r\n- [x] `spack graph --static`, which is supposed to graph the *possible* dependencies of a spec, does what you would expect now (it was concretizing before and only graphing possible deps of what was in the concretized spec).  Now it doesn't concretize; it only traverses the potential dependencies of and generates a graph. Useful if you want to see just how deep dependency hierarchies can go, or if you want to understand all the possible ways packages can depend on each other.\r\n- [x] `spack dependencies` and `spack graph` both support a `--deptype` argument that lets you pick which types of dependencies you want to traverse.  e.g., you can limit things to *just* `run` and `test` deps if you want.\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of changes to `PackageBase` to make all this cleaner.  In particular:\r\n\r\n- [x] `ALLOWED_URL_SCHEMES` was excised; it's vestigial and no longer used -- all of that stuff moved to the fetchers long ago.\r\n- [x] This may be somewhat baffling, but it was no longer entirely clear how packages were getting their `name` set.  It turns out this had moved into `directives.py` and was being done in the `DirectiveMeta` class over in . `directives.py`.  `name` is now class property on PackageBase and a property on `PackageMeta`, consistent with other attributes like it.  Also removed some name-related cruft from the `PackageBase` constructor that was no longer doing anything.\r\n- [x] `PackageBase.possible_dependencies()` is now a class method, so you do not need a package *instance* to run it.\r\n\r\nMore details are in the commits; probably best to read those while reviewing this.",
