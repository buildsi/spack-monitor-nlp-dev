    "body": "fixes #13005\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes an issue with the name of the root directory for module file hierarchies. \r\n\r\nSince #3206 the root folder was named after the microarchitecture used for the spec, which is too specific and not backward compatible for lmod hierarchies. Here we compute the root folder name using the target family instead of the target name itself and we add target information in the \"whatis\" portion of the module file.",
