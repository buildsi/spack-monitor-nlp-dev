    "body": "In #6774, I noticed something interesting. My unit tests were hitting a few lines of code, yet Codecov was complaining that they weren't being hit. I realized this was because the lines were only hit for Python 2.6, and we were only generating coverage reports for Python 2.7/3.6.\r\n\r\nI'm curious to see how many additional lines of coverage we would get by generating coverage reports for all unit and build tests, not just those for Python 2.7/3.6.",
