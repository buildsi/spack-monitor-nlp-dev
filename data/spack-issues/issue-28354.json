    "body": "For me this has been mostly just annoying, cause if I do \r\n`spack env activate ...` and it sets LD_LIBRARY_PATH, system executables that don't\r\nuse rpath will now consider spack-built libs first, and are sometimes\r\nincompatible.\r\n\r\nAnd executables built by Spack already use rpath anyways, so they know\r\nwhere there libs are.\r\n\r\nThe only case is maybe when libs are dlopen'ed by say Python, but even\r\nthen, I think the libs are generally located because of Python's own\r\nrpaths set by Spack.\r\n\r\nCloses #3955",
