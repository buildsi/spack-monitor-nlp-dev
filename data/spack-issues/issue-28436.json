    "body": "I have an automated build for dyninst - you can see the Dockerfile here:  https://github.com/dyninst/dyninst/tree/master/docker built as follows from that directory\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ docker build -t dyninst -f Dockerfile ../\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd it hasn't had an issue building nightly... until last night. It fails to apply a patch and then chokes and dies.\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/814322/149677381-bacc8569-b71d-4972-8c63-408d9600f2b1.png)\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dyninst/dyninst/runs/4833782666?check_suite_focus=true\r\n\r\nI tried pinning to the last spack release, that produced a different error:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/dyninst/dyninst/pull/1185\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/814322/149677443-1bcef7d4-6b0a-4aca-8ec3-7c0789927ff5.png)\r\n\r\nI'm not sure what I can do here - I'd like the build to keep working.
