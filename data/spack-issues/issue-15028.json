    "body": "closes #14802 \r\ncloses #14879\r\n\r\nThis PR reworks a few attributes in the `container` subsection of `spack.yaml` to permit the injection of custom base images both in the build and final stage. In more detail, users can still specify the base operating system and Spack version they want to use:\r\n```yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  container:\r\n    images:\r\n      os: ubuntu:18.04\r\n      spack: develop\r\n```\r\nin which case the generated recipe will use one of the Spack images built on Docker Hub for the build stage and the base OS image in the final stage or alternatively they can specify explicitly the two base images:\r\n```yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  container:\r\n    images:\r\n      build: spack/ubuntu-bionic:latest\r\n      final: ubuntu:18.04\r\n```\r\nand it will be up to them to ensure their consistency. The ability to install OS packages in both the `build` and `final` stage has been retained. Handles to avoid an update of the available system packages have been added to the configuration to facilitate the generation of recipes permitting deterministic builds. \r\n\r\n~Following the discussion in #14917 this PR takes at the moment a minimalist approach and thus removed the possibility to install OS packages in the generated image (if any is needed it should be the custom base image that takes care of that). In case this seems unwanted it will be sufficient to drop commit ed71483 to make this PR compatible with #14917 and #14879.~",
