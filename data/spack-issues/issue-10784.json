    "body": "When trying to use `pip` from a user that did not install the package `py-pip` (and only sources the Spack setup file) I get the following error when trying to install a package with `pip` (before `spack load py-pip` was called):\r\n\r\n```sh\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/opt/spack/opt/spack/linux-centos7-x86_64/gcc-7.3.0/py-pip-19.0.3-u76cust5siazb77mkwx7ks7i77qai6f3/bin/pip\", line 6, in <module>\r\n    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\r\nImportError: No module named pkg_resources\r\n```\r\n\r\nDoing this with the user how installed `py-pip' works. I only see such a clash for `pip` and no other package. Is there any way to solve this?",
