    "body": "Would love to see an Ansible module that would let me install packages with Spack\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nTo install my dev machines (mainly laptops and virtual vms) I've setup years ago some Ansible playbooks. So far the packages I'm installing that way are done with either the specific platform package managers (e.g. brew on Mac, apt on ubuntu, etc...) leading to a lot of distribution specific yml files or from source with \"custom\" recipes. Would be better to leverage Spack power here.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nTypical usage would be to replace things like : \r\n\r\n```\r\n- name: install required packages\r\n  package:\r\n    name: \"{{ item }}\"\r\n    state: present\r\n  loop:\r\n    - git\r\n    - curl\r\n    - bzip2\r\n```\r\nby : \r\n\r\n```\r\n- name: install required packages\r\n  spack:\r\n    name: \"{{ item }}\"\r\n    state: present\r\n  loop:\r\n    - git\r\n    - curl\r\n    - bzip2\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nWhile an Ansible module is not strictly required (I'm currently setting up a custom role instead) it would be much more convenient.  \r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n~/github.com/aphecetche/ansible [asdf-to-spack] $ spack --version\r\n0.14.2\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\nhave searched also more widely for \"ansible spack module\" (and first mainly got hits concerning ... Spark ;-) )\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
