    "body": "I tried to install CUDA on macOS (out of curiosity), but apparently its presence broke `intel-tbb`:\r\n```\r\n==> 'make' '-j8' 'compiler=clang'\r\nCreated ./build/macos_intel64_clang_cc9.0.0 Found CUDA installation: /usr/local/cuda, version unknown_os10.13_release and ..._debug directories\r\n/Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/usr/bin/make -C \"./build/macos_intel64_clang_cc9.0.0 Found CUDA installation: /usr/local/cuda, version unknown_os10.13_debug\"  -r -f ../../build/Makefile.tbb cfg=debug\r\nmake[1]: ../../build/Makefile.tbb: No such file or directory\r\nmake[1]: *** No rule to make target `../../build/Makefile.tbb'.  Stop.\r\nmake: *** [tbb] Error 2\r\n```\r\nNo idea what's going on, neither `homebrew` nor `macports` have any special flags to disable CUDA anyhow. First time I see that `inte-tbb` even cares about CUDA. Anyway, i though to create an issue just in case somone knows an easy fix.\r\n\r\nps. for now, i will simply uninstalled CUDA and the problem is gone.",
