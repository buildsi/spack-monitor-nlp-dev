    "body": "This is a tiny bug fix to ensure that the response has a code attribute before attempting to check its value. I am testing running spack monitor from inside a container and hit this bug, so I'll need this integrated into spack (in one of the base containers used for containerize) before I can continue developing. cc @alecbcs.\r\n\r\nThe branch I'm testing is at https://github.com/spack/spack/compare/develop...vsoch:add/containerize-monitor?expand=1. I've been able to get the environment variables in, but it exits with an error that this e object has no attribute \"code\" and the server is never hit. I suspect something else is going on - and I'll need this fix to see the error message.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
