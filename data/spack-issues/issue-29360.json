    "body": " All of the variants modified here are really expensive to turn on and not required for many builds, so I think it improves the user experience of spack overall to turn them off by default. Apologies to those who assume the current defaults in their workflows and a reminder that the new concretizer makes it easier for packages to explicitly depend on e.g. `mesa+llvm`.",
