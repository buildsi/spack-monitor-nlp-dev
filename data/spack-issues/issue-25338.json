    "body": "This PR adds the package esys-particle. \r\n\r\nThe maintainers are transitioning to cmake from autotools, so I had to make some changes to make it actually detect python correctly. It's still cleaner than the autotools implementation.\r\n\r\nDespite being listed as an alpha this is listed as the latest 'release' for the software and seems the best to target with the future in mind.",
