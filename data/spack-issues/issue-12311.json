    "body": "Closes #2184\r\n\r\n* the default edit scope is \"user\" (`~/.spack/`) unless there is an existing configuration file in the `user/$platform` scope (e.g. `~/.spack/darwin/compilers.yaml`)\r\n* (EDIT 8/23 - forgot to mention) for the `compilers` section, the default edit scope is always `user/$platform`, even if no configuration file exists at the `user/$platform` scope\r\n* add a `config.yaml` variable called `default_edit_scope` which lets users set where this occurs\r\n* add a `$platform` config variable which expands to the platform from which Spack is being run: this allows users to explicitly set `default_edit_scope: user/$platform`\r\n* Note that if a user sets any scope without including `$platform`, Spack will always try to use the corresponding platform scope if a file exists for it\r\n* (EDIT: added) Remove the `spack.util.path` module and move all functions in it into `spack.config`\r\n* (EDIT: added) updated tests to check these rules and the `$platform` variable expansion\r\n\r\nTODOs:\r\n\r\n- [x] Handle item (3) of #2184\r\n- [ ] (?) should it be possible for users to indicate that they want to edit the non-platform version of a section?",
