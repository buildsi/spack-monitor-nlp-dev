    "body": "### Summary\n\nWhen building on macOS, the target deployment version defaults to the current version being run. Like with `arch` flags, it would be useful to be able to give a maximum deployment target through a simple flag on macOS. `cflags` and such can be used, but it needs passed to every language, so Fortran in the stack would require `fflags` as well. Additionally, some build systems may have simpler ways of handling it (e.g., `CMAKE_OSX_DEPLOYMENT_TARGET` for CMake), so an abstracted-out setting would be useful.\n\n### Rationale\n\nIn CI, it can be useful to prep Spack in a separate job so that multiple configurations of a project can share a single Spack base (instead of rerunning nearly identical Spack builds for every configuration). To make this viable, the Spack pre-build stage must be restricted in what its binaries end up using.\n\n### Description\n\n`spack install frobnitz macos_target=10.13`\n\n### Additional information\n\n```console\r\n$ bin/spack --version\r\n0.16.3-5063-c13f915735\r\n```\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
