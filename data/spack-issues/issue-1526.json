    "body": "subj. I would say for starters, one-to-many (one package many tags) without hierarchies of tags is perfectly enough to help users better orient in packages.\n\nAs a CLI i think it's enough to have:\n\n```\nspack tags                   (show all tags with their short description, two column print out)\nspack list --tag=<var>       (show all packages from a tag <var>)\nspack find --tag=<var>       (show all installed packages from a tag <var>)\n```\n\nEach package declare tags via:\n\n```\ntags = one, two, three\n```\n\nwith some (manual) checks that `one, two, three` are contained in the list of tags stored in `repo.yaml` as a pairs of strings `name - description`.\n\nin reference to the discussion  https://groups.google.com/forum/?fromgroups#!topic/spack/zGs-0RKz3_U\n",
