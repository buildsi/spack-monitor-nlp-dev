    "body": "Attempting to create a view that erroneously links packages with the same name into the same prefix results in a somewhat cryptic error message: `Error: the transactional move of \".../views/default\" failed.` A different error message, which tells the end user directly about the conflict, or what might be done to correct the view definition, would be an improvement.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nCreate an environment \"env\" with a view that would link two packages with the same name into the same prefix. Say, package \"foo\" built for two different targets \"A\" and \"B\", and the following view description\r\n```yaml\r\nview:\r\n  default:\r\n    root: views/default\r\n    select: [foo]\r\n    projections:\r\n      all: '{name}'\r\n```\r\n```console\r\n$ spack concretize\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n```console\r\nError: the transactional move of \".../var/spack/environments/env/views/default\" failed.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-687-81bb372d7\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.2\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-cascadelake\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
