    "body": "Instead of only allowing specs to be given as positional arguments, this change allows the user to give the spec via the path to a yaml file on disk, ala:\r\n\r\n``` console\r\nspack location --stage-dir -f /path/to/pkgconf.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is already possible in the `spack install ...` command, so hopefully it make sense here as well, and is easy to review.",
