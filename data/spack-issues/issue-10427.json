    "body": "- Bump the version to 7.0.1\r\n- Fix openmp build time dependency (Depends on #10425, will rebase once merged)\r\n- Fix lldb stability issue with libstdc++ < from gcc < 4.9\r\n  - See https://github.com/llvm/llvm-project/blob/f9ebacfd299c7711b5b3a3fae5f36b61e14a580e/lldb/cmake/modules/LLDBConfig.cmake#L424-L443 for details\r\n  - Since compilers like PGI, Intel, and Cray tend to use the C++ library from some system-supplied GCC installation, there's not currently a reliable way to check in the package file whether or not exception handling is needed.  It's not particularly harmful and generally useful so always enabling it should be a reliable safe bet.",
