    "body": "If you look at the [Basic Usage docs](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/basic_usage.html#seeing-installed-packages), you'll see that the GPG docs were accidentally put in the middle of the `spack find` documentation.\r\n\r\nThis PR moves this section of the documentation to Getting Started. From my understanding of `spack gpg`, this is something that users will do when they first set up Spack, so it makes more sense to put in Getting Started. In my mind, Basic Usage is for everyday commands that users will continue to run while Getting Started is for one-time setup.\r\n\r\nThanks to @ssergien for pointing this out.",
