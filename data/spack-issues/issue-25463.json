    "body": "Previous version used a patch file to inject a CMake build file.\r\nThis CMake file didn't handle the OpenMP support, nor the handling of the FFTW dependency.\r\n\r\nThis moves to using the shipped Makefile, however it requires some heavy modification to integrate with Spack, I think I have hit them all.\r\n\r\nThis now enables the package to be used with multiple compilers and FFTW implementations.\r\nTested with GCC, ACfL and NVHPC and FFTW and ArmPL (for `fftw-api`).",
