    "body": "Fixes #22386. @G-Ragghianti \r\n\r\nSeparate spack instances installing to separate install trees can fight over the same stage directory because we do not currently unique stage paths by instance.\r\n\r\n- [x] add a new `$instance` substitution that gives an 8-character hash unique to the spack instance (base32 digits from SHA1 of prefix)\r\n- [x] make the default stage directory use `$instance`\r\n- [x] rework `spack.util.path.substitute_config_variables()` so that expensive operations like hashing are done lazily, not at module load time.",
