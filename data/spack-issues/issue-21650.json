    "body": "When building octave 6.1.0 with fltk support, there is no build error, but the resulting build does not use fltk.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install octave@6.1.0  +fftw  +fontconfig +freetype +gnuplot +curl +fltk\r\n...\r\n```\r\nLack of fltk functionality can be verified by running the octave-6.1.0 binary, and checking the value of available_graphics_toolkits(). It will be found that only the gnuplot toolkit is available, i.e. the fltk support was not linked into the binary.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-1262-0724467ad2\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<https://octave.1599824.n4.nabble.com/Octave-3-4-2-with-fltk-support-td3627783.html> indicates that mesa support must be available at link time in order for fltk support to be functional. Probably mesa should be added as a dependency for fltk.\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [ x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
