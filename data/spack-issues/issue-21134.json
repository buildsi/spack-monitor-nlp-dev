    "body": "There is no `--with-icc` configure option starting version 3.8.0: https://github.com/python/cpython/commit/98929b545e86e7c7296c912d8f34e8e8d3fd6439.\r\n\r\nFor older versions that have the option, setting it without an argument sets the values of `CC` and `CXX` to `icc` and `icpc`, respectively: https://github.com/python/cpython/blob/117830de332c8dfbd9a437c0968e16e11aa7e6a1/configure.ac#L586-L587. These values are then stored in the `sysconfigdata`, which leads to extensions being built with the compilers in the `PATH`, instead of the compilers that Python was built with.\r\n\r\nBasically, with this PR we get the same behaviour for `intel` as we already have for `gcc`.",
