    "body": "fixes #28256\r\n\r\nA few packages have version directives evaluated within if statements, conditional on the value of `platform.platform()`.\r\n\r\nSometimes there are no cases for e.g. `platform=darwin` and that causes a lot of spurious failures with version existence audits. This PR allows expressing conditions to skip version existence checks in audits and avoid these spurious reports.",
