    "body": "This pull request adds the libfive solid modeling package. It depends weakly on #12333; some OSes package GNU Guile 2.2.1 or later, so this dependency could be installed in Spack via `packages.yaml` instead. However, for users that do not configure `packages.yaml` to register an installation of GNU Guile 2.2.1 or later, merging #12333 will be required.",
