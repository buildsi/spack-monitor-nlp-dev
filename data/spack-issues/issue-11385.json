    "body": "repeatmasker 4.0.9 made some changes to the interactive configure script,\r\nwhich required some refactoring in the package recipe.\r\n\r\nThe generation of spack-config.in was modified to be clearer about how lines were written,\r\nand perl is now pulled from `which` instead of `inspect.getmodule(self)` which seemed to stop working for some reason.\r\n\r\nChanges were tested to be backwards compatible with the existing 4.0.7 version.",
