Although this should probably be fixed upstream, it does look like the warning has been around [for some time](https://clang.debian.net/logs/2013-01-28/blacs-mpi_1.1-31_unstable_clang.log) and so I'm guessing that its not a critical error. It builds fine for me, but I have not yet tested it.\r\n\r\nRelates to https://github.com/dealii/dealii/issues/11138",
