    "body": "The changes in this pull request modify the [`include` section](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html#included-configurations) of the Spack environment configuration to support Spack's [configuration file variables](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#config-file-variables). These changes make it much simpler to share and refer to local Spack configuration files, e.g.:\r\n\r\n#### Environment File 1 ####\r\n```\r\nspack:\r\n  include:\r\n  - $spack/env/repos.yaml\r\n\r\n  specs:\r\n  - builtin_package1\r\n  - local_package1\r\n```\r\n#### Environment File 2 ####\r\n```\r\nspack:\r\n  include:\r\n  - $spack/env/repos.yaml\r\n\r\n  specs:\r\n  - builtin_package2\r\n  - local_package1\r\n```",
