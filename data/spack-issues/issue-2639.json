    "body": "More updates to NCO. This time I'm removing the `+mpi` variant, as it doesn't do anything for this package. If you want to build NCO with NetCDF MPI support, you need to run `spack install nco ^netcdf+mpi`.\r\n\r\nP.S. I'm currently working with one of the NCO developers, Charlie Zender, to get this package installed properly on our clusters, so I may have further updates coming. Don't merge just yet.",
