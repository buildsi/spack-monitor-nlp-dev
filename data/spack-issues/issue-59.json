    "body": "A number of packages, I noticed tmux but there are others, have sourceforge links of the form:\n\n```\nhttp://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/tmux/tmux/tmux-1.9/tmux-1.9a.tar.gz\n```\n\nThese used to work as download links with redirect handling, but now a timestamp appears to be required.  This new form appears to work (on wget from a shell):\n\n```\nhttp://downloads.sourceforge.net/project/tmux/tmux/tmux-1.9/tmux-1.9a.tar.gz?ts=$(date +%s)&use_mirror=autoselect\n```\n\nNot sure what the best way to address this is, but a url-handler for sourceforge might be in order.\n",
