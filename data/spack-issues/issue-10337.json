    "body": "I have included variants for everything I could see. I am not really happy with how I had to handle the inclusion of the libboost_python library, but unless I explicitly specify where this is, the cmake claims it can't find it and refuses to build the python bindings. I would welcome any advice on a cleaner way to find the exact name of this .so file. \r\n",
