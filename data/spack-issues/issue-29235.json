    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install gptune\r\n```\r\n\r\nSpack concretization leads to using `cray-libsci` as implementation of BLAS (even though I'm not on a Cray system), but the `install` function of this package raises an exception saying it's not buildable and should be provided as external. It's not really spack's fault, but I suppose there should be a better way for a package to declare that it's not buildable, so that spack can remove it from the set of possibilities if it doesn't see it available externally.\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\n<details><summary>Error message</summary><pre>\r\ncray-libsci is not installable, you need to specify it as an external package in packages.yaml\r\n</pre></details>\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-1106-c1b51d6\r\n* **Python:** 2.7.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-broadwell\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\r\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
