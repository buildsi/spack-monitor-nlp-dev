    "body": "JDK has a fairly complicated versioning scheme:\r\nhttp://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/8u92-relnotes-2949471.html\r\n\r\nThe latest release can be described as:\r\n\r\n1. JDK 8, Update 92, Build 14\r\n2. 8u92\r\n3. 1.8.0_92-b14\r\n\r\nWe are currently using format 2, although 3 is more in line with how other software is versioned. Does anyone mind if I change things to 3? I would update the packages that depend on it too.",
