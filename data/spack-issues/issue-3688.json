Here we go.\r\n\r\nI have two questions about (and as usual, any feedback is welcome):\r\n\r\n- the instructions say it needs *gcc*.  I build and use a gcc, so I get it without depending on it.  Should I depend on it anyway?  (There's a `depends_on()` that's commented out, for now)\r\n\r\n- what's the right spec for Python.  The docs requires \"< 3\".  Should I use \":2.99.999\" or ....\r\n\r\nWhen you build this, it goes out to the internet and drags a bunch of node/npm stuff into it's installation directory.  They have it fairly tightly controlled (\"npm shrinkwrap?\"), but it's still not air-gappable.\r\n\r\n",
