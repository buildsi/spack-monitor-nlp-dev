    "body": "This is a blocker for #26599 where tests suddenly started failing because\n\n```\nspack.binary_distribution.binary_index\n```\n\nhas state leaking between tests.\n\nIn particular, `archive-files` which was pushed to a local mirror in one test, was later pulled during a spack install in an entirely unrelated test, which then failed, because there was no gpg signature for it. :(.\n\nAfter fixing individual tests, other failures creeped in, namely \n\n```\ntest_patchelf_is_relocatable\n```\n\nreferencing a patchelf binary from a buildcache, which did not exist anymore at the time the test was executed. I have no clue and don't want to figure out why.\n\nWhat's important is that tests shouldn't leak state, and hence the second commit of this PR resets\n\n```\nspack.binary_distribution.binary_index\n```\n\nat the end of every test, hopefully solving the issue.\n\nThis would hopefully be a temporary measure until someone takes on the project of getting rid of those great globals sprinkled around in Spack.\n",
