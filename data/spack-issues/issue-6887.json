This may compromise the execution of:\r\n```\r\n$ coverage combine\r\n$ codecov --required\r\n```\r\nand in the end the coverage report from `codecov` (see data from January 2018, where it dropped from ~75% to ~50%). \r\n\r\n#6872 has been merged as a work-around to get more stable measurements, but the underlying issue with `pytest` + `multiprocessing` + `coverage` needs to be investigated further.\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart @tgamblin @scheibelp @becker33 ",
