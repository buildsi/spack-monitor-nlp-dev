    "body": "I'm wondering if spack has a bug related to \"develop\" version processing or if I am attempting something that is not supported.  I'm trying to build a development version of one of our components, cbtf-krell.  Inside the cbtf-krell package.py file, I have a \r\n```depends_on(dyninst@9.3.2:\", when='@develop')```\r\nstatement.    In my build area, I have a version of dyninst/package.py that has a develop version per #8181.\r\n\r\nShould line 103 force the build of the dyninst development version?\r\n\r\n```\r\n   100\t    depends_on(\"boost@1.66.0\", when='@1.9.1.0:')\r\n   101\t\r\n   102\t    # For Dyninst\r\n   103\t    depends_on(\"dyninst@9.3.2:\", when='@develop')\r\n   104\t    depends_on(\"dyninst@9.3.2\", when='@1.9.1.0:')\r\n   105\t\r\n   106\t    # For MRNet\r\n   107\t    depends_on(\"mrnet@5.0.1-3:+cti\", when='@develop+cti')\r\n   108\t    depends_on(\"mrnet@5.0.1-3:+lwthreads\", when='@develop')\r\n```\r\nWhen I try to build cbtf-krell@develop, spack wants to build dyninst-9.3.2.
