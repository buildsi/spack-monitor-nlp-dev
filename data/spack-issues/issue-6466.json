    "body": "As requested by @junghans in #6431, I have restricted the patch to specific versions. Since it also applies cleanly to 3.2 and older (the last substantial change to that file was in 2006) and should remain valid for any upcoming 4.0.x version, I used a version range. 4.1, once it's released, won't need the patch anymore, but will require changes to the  `configure` method.",
