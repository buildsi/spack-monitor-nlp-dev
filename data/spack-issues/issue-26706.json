    "body": "TL;DR only track EnvironmentModifications origins under --debug.\r\n\r\nCurrently Spack keeps track of the origin in the code of any\r\nmodification to the environment variables. This is very slow. In fact\r\nit's enabled unconditionally even in code paths where the origin of the\r\nmodification is never queried.\r\n\r\nThe only place where we inspect the origins of environment modifications\r\nis before we start a build, IF there's an override of the type\r\n`e.set(...)` after incremental changes like `e.append_path(..)`, which\r\nis a \"suspicious\" change.\r\n\r\nThis is very rare though.\r\n\r\nIf an override like this ever happens, it might mean a package is\r\nbroken. If that leads to build errors, we can just ask the user to run\r\n`spack -d install ...` and check the warnings issued by Spack to find\r\nthe origins of the problem.\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\nThe upside for me is that this cuts down running spack unit-test by a minute.\r\n",
