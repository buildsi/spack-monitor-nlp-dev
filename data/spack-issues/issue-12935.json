    "body": "On RHEL7, I have Spack installed packages built with GCC 4.8.5 and also 7.3.0. The ones built with GCC 4.8.5 are tagged `haswell`, the ones built with 7.3.0 are tagged `broadwell`. I have created binaries of ALL these packages and put them in a mirror. `spack buildcache list` only shows me the binaries tagged `broadwell` even though I'm running it on the exact same machine where the packages were originally built.",
