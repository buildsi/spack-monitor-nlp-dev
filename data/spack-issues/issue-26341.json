    "body": "On shared systems with a system-wide versioned programming environment\nwhere the user can switch between different versions (and test the\nlatest the greatest when they feel like it), it's convenient to provide\na config for compilers and packages depending on the programming\nenvironment version. It'd also be nice if the user could use their own\nversion of Spack on their favorite commit, and pick up config without\nhaving to back up their user config and replacing it with something\ntemporarily when switching programming environment versions.\n\nWith this change, people managing the system can provide compilers.yaml\nand packages.yaml versioned with the programming environment:\n\n```\n/path/to/programming/environment/1.2.3/{compilers,packages}.yaml\n```\n\nand set `SPACK_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH` to point to this dir.\n\nIn particular, on Cray systems this variable could be set in a module\ncalled `spack-system-config`, and the user could opt in to use it, and\ndoesn't have to know about whatever programming environment verison they\nare in.\n\nAs a bonus, if somebody would ever put Spack config files in\n`/etc/spack`, the user can now opt out of that by setting\n\n```\nSPACK_SYSTEM_CONFIG_PATH=/non-existing/dir\n```\n",
