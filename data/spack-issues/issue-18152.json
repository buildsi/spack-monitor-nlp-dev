It's also not listed in the [prerequisites](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#prerequisites).\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-592-319d160\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.3\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-cascadelake\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x ] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
