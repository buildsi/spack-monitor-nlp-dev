Here we work around the issue by putting our vendored version of the package under an additional namespace.\r\n\r\nNote that we do this only for `ruamel.yaml` rather than consistently for every vendored dependency to avoid extensive changes in their source code, see https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/9206#issuecomment-435041643",
