    "body": "I'm not sure how to fix this, but it's very difficult to find a lot of stuff on readthedocs.\r\n\r\nFor example, as a quick way of finding information about the variant function, I will try to type 'variant' into the search bar on readthdocs. This however doesn't return very useful hits. At least not a definition of variant and how to use it.\r\n\r\nThe first hit is the spack packages API doc list and the only appearances of variant I can see is in reference to tests..\r\n\r\nAnyway, I just wanted to start a discussion about this and see if anybody knew how to make this search function better. At this time I have no idea how to do it.",
