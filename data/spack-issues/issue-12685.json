    "body": "Salvaged from #12636, this PR reworks how some of the shell scripts in the docker images work.  The most visible effect of these changes are that downstream image builds now have access to a few commands implemented as shell functions, mostly for cleanly starting and stopping sshd.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```Dockerfile\r\nFROM spack/centos7\r\n\r\nRUN spack install my-mpi-app \\\r\n && ssh_init \\\r\n && some-command-that-uses-mpi # needs ssh \\\r\n && ssh_clear\r\n\r\n...\r\n```",
