    "body": "Not sure if this is a duplicate issue but it would be nice to have the ability to specify variants for external packages and have them used. An example:\r\n\r\nWe want to link with cray-petsc and there are currently 4 different cray-petsc's to link to: \r\n{cray-petsc, cray-petsc-64, cray-petsc-complex, cray-petsc-complex-64} \r\n\r\nI was hoping to be able to add this to packages.yaml \r\n\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n   petsc:\r\n       buildable: false\r\n       modules:\r\n             petsc@X.X.X: cray-petsc\r\n             petsc@X.X.X+int64: cray-petsc-64\r\n             petsc@X.X.X+complex: cray-petsc-complex\r\n             petsc@X.X.X+int64+complex: cray-petsc-complex-64\r\n```\r\n\r\nUnfortunately whenever I do spack spec petsc+int64 or any of the ones with variants, I always get the defaults set by package.py. \r\n\r\nThis is a problem since some of the cray packages we need to link with have variants with them.\r\n",
