    "body": "This PR proposes to add the option `spack find --location` in order to show in the output if a package is in the \"local\" instance or in an upstream one.\r\n\r\nExample outputs:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack find --location -p\r\n...\r\njnnhvza ^ncurses@6.1            /usr\r\npwndliw ^openssl@1.1.0i         /usr\r\nus6svq2  pkg-config@0.29.2      /usr\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack find --location -l\r\n...\r\nnn75hgd ^git@2.16.4\r\n```\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack find --location\r\n...\r\n^git@2.16.4\r\n```\r\n\r\nI find it useful when managing chained instances: e.g. a few times I found myself not understanding why I was not able to uninstall a package (i.e. getting a \"not found\" error from `spack uninstall`) and just later I realized it was in the upstream instance.\r\n\r\nThought it may be useful.\r\n\r\nLooking forward for your feedback and suggestions.",
