    "body": "The package munges the various perl scripts so that their sbang lines point to the depended upon perl (perhaps with the Spack sbanger in the dance) instead of relying on `/usr/bin/env perl`.\r\n\r\nAs it stands it installs its Perl libraries into `prefix/lib` and then depends on `setup_environment` to prepend that dir onto PERL5LIB.\r\n\r\nSee my [vcftools issue #80](https://github.com/vcftools/vcftools/issues/80) for a discussion about fixing its non-functional attempt at isolating itself from PERL5LIB shenanigans.\r\n\r\nThis package need not wait for the resolution of that issue (see [vcftools issue #77](https://github.com/vcftools/vcftools/issues/77) for a discussion about whether the project is abandoned).",
