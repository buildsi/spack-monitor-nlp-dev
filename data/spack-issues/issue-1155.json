    "body": "@tgamblin  @scheibelp \n\nHere are specs for a poposed Spack-Conda Integration.  Comments/suggestions appreciated!\n\nGeneral idea: Spack will be used to produce a set of Conda recipes, from a set of Conda recipe templates.  Each Conda recipe is fully qualified and has fixed dependencies (aka EasyBuild).  Conda will be used downstream to actually build and distribute the software in question.\n1. There are three repos here:\n   1. Conda template repo: A set of templates that are used to produce final versioned Conda recipes.\n   2. Spack repo: A set of `package.py` files, etc, corresponding to the Conda templates.\n   3. Destination Conda repo: The fully specified Conda packages to be generated.  This is like the Spack install tree.  The recipes in the Spack package will create files in the destination Condo repo.\n2. The Conda template repo should be auto-generatable from a standard Conda repo: basically, identify places in the `yaml` files that need to have templated items in them.  This auto-generation does not have to be the first step.\n3. The Spack repo should be (almost) auto-generatable from the Conda tempalte repo.  But users will have to manually add information about virtual dependencies.\n4. The build process for packages in the Spack repo will simply fill in appropriate info in the Conda template, and produce a final Conda package.\n   1. Spack has its own idea of how the destination file tree is structured.  That will need to be modified so it can write into a Conda-format tree.\n",
