    "body": "- Add newest dd4hep version.\r\n- Add patch for adding `C` to cmake languages to work around problem in certain environments (See #24232). The patch is also submitted upstream to dd4hep, so that it should become available with the next release.\r\n- Also adding a conflict for certain cmake and dd4hep versions, because for some time the matching of python versions to root was broken, and fixing this would require a few different patches to be applied depending on the dd4hep version.\r\n\r\nFixes #24232 \r\n\r\n@vvolkl @andresailer does this look reasonable to you?",
