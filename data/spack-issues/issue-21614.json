    "body": "Building `doxygen` on Ubuntu 18.04 causes gcc to hang in an infinite loop.  Explicitly disabling partial inlining in the one file it hangs on seems to address the issue. To the best I can determine the problem is isolated to `gcc 7.x` and `doxygen @1.8.20:` since both Ubuntu 20.0.4 with `%gcc@9` and RHEL8 with `%gcc@8.3` successfully compile as is and `doxygen @1.8.17` on Ubuntu 18.0.4 with `%gcc@7.5` does as well.",
