    "body": "This is an optimization of #24811 that attempts to improve the performance of `spack buildcache update-index`.\r\n\r\nThis change looks at each `spec.yaml` in the mirror (call this the \"candidate\"), and checks all dependencies of each one to see if full hashes match between the dependencies recorded in the candidate spec.yaml and the spec.yamls of the dependencies themselves.  If any differences are found, the spec associated with the candidate spec.yaml is spliced with the correct dependencies, and it is pushed back to the mirror.  Once all the spec.yaml files are fixed up, the index is generated and pushed to the mirror as well.",
