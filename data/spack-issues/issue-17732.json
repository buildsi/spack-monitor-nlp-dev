Since in Github actions one can't restart a single job but needs to restart an entire workflow, here we group tests with similar duration together. The benefit is that if a test lasting 1 min. is hanging we don't need to restart a few other ones that would take much longer to complete.\r\n\r\n**Fetch all branches and tags:** MacOS unit tests started failing as the MacOS virtual environment was upgraded to use git 2.28.0 The mechanism leading to the failure is well explained in #17754 description. This PR solves the issue by fetching the whole history from Spack repository and by using `git branch develop origin/develop` instead of `git fetch -u origin develop:develop`.",
