    "body": "After upgrading to macOS 10.14.4, GCC 8.3.0 does not build any more. The issue is unrelated to Spack; even a vanilla GCC fails to install.\r\n\r\n[This](https://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/355049/compilation-error-with-mojave-error-atomic-does-not-name-a-type/355103#355103) is a description of the error message. The underlying problem is that a macOS header file uses the `_Atomic` keyword for C++ code, although this is only a C keyword. The proper work-around is probably adding a \"fixinclude\" for GCC. [This](https://gist.github.com/eschnett/f912c6b791e29c83477575017271db16) describes the respective patch that is necessary. [This](https://github.com/eschnett/spack/commit/d9f16b6e9a38ab1a3cd78f1746e9fc8495b9f63e) is a commit for my Spack branch that can likely be cherry-picked. (I plan to open a pull request for this unless someone else beats me to it.)\r\n",
