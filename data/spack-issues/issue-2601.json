    "body": "Openblas was failing to build on our CHAOS 5 x86_64 clusters. One issue is that it was trying to add AVX2 instructions for a platform that did not have it, so I made avx2 a variant that is off by default. I am open to this being on by default if others think we should. I was also getting link errors during the build. This appears to be due to the parallel build, so I added \"parallel = false\". ",
