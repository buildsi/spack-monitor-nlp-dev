    "body": "By default, `py-pyqt5` installs its qt designer and qml plugins into `qt`'s install prefix, and we don't want that.\r\n\r\nI tested qt's `designer` with this fix and it correctly lists the pyqt5 plugin thanks to  `QT_PLUGIN_PATH`. But I wasn't able to simply test the qml plugin, but I found a couple reference saying `QT_PLUGIN_PATH` should work for qml plugins too.\r\n\r\nEDIT: for the record:\r\n```\r\n$ spack verify .../qt-5.15.2-i46xrjybjytgf6fdnseiu37p37g44242/.spack/spec.yaml\r\n==> In package qt/i46xrjy\r\n.../qt-5.15.2-i46xrjybjytgf6fdnseiu37p37g44242/plugins/PyQt5 verification failed with error(s):\r\n    added\r\n.../qt-5.15.2-i46xrjybjytgf6fdnseiu37p37g44242/plugins/PyQt5/libpyqt5qmlplugin.so verification failed with error(s):\r\n    added\r\n.../qt-5.15.2-i46xrjybjytgf6fdnseiu37p37g44242/plugins/designer/libpyqt5.so verification failed with error(s):\r\n    added\r\n```\r\n",
