    "body": "Documentation does not always link a command to its documentation.\r\n\r\nThis link is useful because, IMO, it makes is easy to find a command documentation from command reference page.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nCommand Reference (in command_index.in) states:\r\n> Commands that also have sections in the main documentation have a link to\r\n> \"More documentation\".\r\n\r\nI see this link for `spack clean` (points to spack clean in packaging_guide), but not for `spack ci` and associated subcommands (should point to spack ci in pipelines).\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nI tried re-building the documentation, no sign of error.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think it depends on the system\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nI read a bit more about this, and talked to @becker33:\r\n- If `spack ci` should be referenced somewhere for the link to be generated, I couldn\u2019t find where.\r\n- On the contrary, I\u202fthink this is supposed to be automatically generated through `SpackArgparsRstWriter()` and `rst()` functions, but I could not find what\u2019s wrong with `spack ci` in particular, or `pipeline.rst`.\r\n\r\nMaybe @scottwittenburg has some clues too?\r\n",
