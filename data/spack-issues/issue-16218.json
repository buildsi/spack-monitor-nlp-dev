    "body": "The changes in this pull request update the `py-numpy` package's `python` dependencies to include the `+ssl` variant. I found this to be necessary to compile when messing around with variants related to #16217. \r\n\r\nThe only variant of this install that was tested was `py-numpy@1.11.3+blas+lapack` in the build environment `gcc%4.9.3 arch=linux-rhel7-broadwell`.",
