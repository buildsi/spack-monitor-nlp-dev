    "body": "This PR adds a `spack checkout` command to update the spack source to a particular git revision.\r\n\r\nThis PR builds on the \"deployment mode\" feature to restrict `spack checkout` to the origin remote when in deployment mode. This will allow users with permission to run Spack, but not to modify the source, to select a git revision to use.\r\n\r\nRequires #21189",
