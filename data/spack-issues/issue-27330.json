Based on #8165 , this seems to be \"expected\" (although there should be a requirement to use an older version of gcc?).\r\nAny hint or help about this would be appreciated, thanks! @citibeth\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7513672/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n[spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7513673/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
