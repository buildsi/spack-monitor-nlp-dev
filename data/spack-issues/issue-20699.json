    "body": "Currently the Parmetis wrapper is disabled which means nested dissection cannot be used with PTScotch in PETSc.\r\n\r\nIf you guys agree, I am willing to work on another PR that would allow using all partitioning features available in PETSc with PTScotch (as if installed with `--download-ptscotch`). It will require some discussions because I am not sure which approach I should use.",
