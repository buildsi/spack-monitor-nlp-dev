    "body": "There's a comment in the openssl package.py noting that it also requires \"make\" and \"perl\".\r\n\r\nIt needs more than just \"perl\", it also needs (at least) \"Test::More\", which some distro's (cough CentOS cough) have teased out of the perl package.\r\n\r\nMy minimal-oid dev image happens to have `/usr/bin/perl`, but not `Test::More`.  I'm not sure why this has worked in the past, probably because I've had a linuxbrew tree on my path that gave me a more modern perl (Does that make me a package manager traitor?).\r\n\r\nJust checking if there's a reason to not add the dependency.\r\n\r\nIf there's no problem I'll submit a PR.",
