    "body": "This is my second attempt to address #6076 but with minimal changes:\r\n\r\n- Fix for `ConfigFormatError`. It doesn't fail to initialize anymore if the validated schema contains an array: TypeError: list indices must be integers, not str.\r\n- Fix for `schema/compilers.py`: it doesn't allow for almost an arbitrary set of properties anymore.\r\n- Tests to check that the fixes work.",
