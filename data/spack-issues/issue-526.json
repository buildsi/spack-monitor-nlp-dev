    "body": "This update provides download and build information for newly released cmake/3.5.0.  Additionally, I added two variants for cmake:\n  +qt builds the cmake-gui application (but adds a dependency on qt)\n  +sphinx builds and installs the HTML documentation for cmake (useful when working with cmake on systems that don't have access to the internet). This variant depends on python and py-sphinx.\n\nBecause the default version of qt in spack is 5.4.0 and this version has known issues with cmake, I also provide instructions for downloading and installing qt/5.4.2 and I added a exception in cmake/package.py that will throw if the +qt variant is requested with qt@5.4.0.\n",
