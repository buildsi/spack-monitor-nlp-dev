    "body": "I'm trying to install LLVM 3.7.1 on a Linux system. This system only has Python 2.6 installed, but LLVM requires Python 2.7, but does not work with Python 3. I thus added a dependency `python@2.7:2.999`.\n\nLLVM also requires cmake, which also requires Python. Spack thus built cmake, depending on Python 3.5.\n\nWhen building LLVM, Spack resolved the cmake dependency to the existing cmake, and thus settled for using Python 3.5. This then leads to a dependency error, since LLVM doesn't work with Python 3.\n\nI need to explicitly add an LLVM dependency on Python 2.7.11 to resolve this.\n",
