    "body": "I'd like to \"gift\" the git package with the ability to install the completion bits that live in the `contrib` subdirectory, basically doing [what the homebrew git recipe does](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/git.rb#L125-L132).\r\n\r\nI'm scratching my head about where to install the bits.\r\n\r\nI see that @alalazo has a [TODO about adding completion support in the node.js package](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/8c650303ffdd02c4be273efbce1674706c0182cd/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/node-js/package.py#L77) as well as a commented-out dependency and variant.  I don't see any other evidence of packages adding completion bits.\r\n\r\nI'm on a CentOS 7 system that has all of the RHEL/CentOS bits installed in `/usr/share/bash-completion`.\r\n\r\nI see that Spack has a [`bash-completion` package](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/81a5146b1df1f69172c0f76bc3dbe469f4e366f9/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/bash-completion/package.py) that overlaps with the CentOS stuff (perhaps being newer).  It also pulls in a bash.\r\n\r\nI'd like to put the completion files someplace that would be useful to *either/or/both* of consumers of the system's bash-completion bits or the Spack bits.\r\n\r\nThe best idea I have it to tuck them into $(spack location -i git).\r\n\r\nAnyone have a better way to do it?",
