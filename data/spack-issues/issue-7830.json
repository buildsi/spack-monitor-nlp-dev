Ideally, the two can be merged at the same time.\r\n\r\nSetup is a developer tool that makes it easy to configure CMake-based packages to use Spack-built dependencies.  When Spack installs a package as \"setup\", it does not download, build or install that package.  Instead, it creates a Python script `<package>-config.py` that, when run, will call CMake with appropriate configuration options.\r\n\r\nSyntax is as follows:\r\n```\r\nspack install --setup pkg1,pkg2 --setup pkg3 ... spec\r\n```\r\nThis will install the DAG represented by `spec`, while installing `pkg1`, `pkg2` and `pkg3` in setup mode.  Most common is to install the top of the DAG only as setup:\r\n```\r\nspack install --setup spec spec\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. When a package is installed as \"setup\", Spack still creates a module and database entry, as it would for any other installation.  As far as Spack is concerned, the packages is fully installed.  The user is then *required* to complete the installation.  Overall use might be as follows:\r\n```\r\nspack install --setup mypackage mypackage\r\ncd mypackage-source-dir\r\nmkdir build\r\ncd build\r\n../../mypackage-config.py\r\nmake\r\nmake install\r\n```\r\n\r\n1. Because Spack does not actually install packages in \"setup\" mode, any packages that depend on a setup package *must* also bee \"installed\" in \"setup\" mode.  This restriction is not currently checked.\r\n\r\n1. Setup mode currently only works for packages subclassing from `CMakePackage`.  Similar work could be done for other build systems, as well as ad-hoc packages.\r\n\r\nNOTES:\r\n\r\n* Setup was added to previous versions of Spack; but was never merged and suffered bitrot.  This is the third (!) time the `spack setup` capability has been added to Spack; and hopefully we can get it merged this time!\r\n\r\n* This PR contains the minimal changes needed to get Spack setup working.  The separate `spack setup` command in previous incarnations has been removed for simplicity.\r\n\r\n* Future commits to this PR will allow for the use of Spack setup in environments.\r\n",
