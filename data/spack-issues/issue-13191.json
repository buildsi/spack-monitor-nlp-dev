With the restricted web access, there is one dependency library wasn't installed successfully which failed with fetching from the mirrors in the internet. \r\nI put downloaded tar.gz file in my local mirror folder as mentioned in https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mirrors.html.\r\nThen I installed the mission package again, I found Spack still use Curl to fetch from the file location which has tarball file as following log:\r\n\r\n==> Installing pkgconf\r\n==> Searching for binary cache of pkgconf\r\n==> Finding buildcaches in /spack/location/mirrors//build_cache\r\n==> No binary for pkgconf found: installing from source\r\n==> Fetching file:///mirrors/location/pkgconf/pkgconf-1.6.3.tar.xz\r\n**curl: (37) Couldn't open file /mirrors/location/pkgconf/pkgconf-1.6.3.tar.xz\r\n==> Fetching from file:///mirrors/location/pkgconf/pkgconf-1.6.3.tar.xz failed.**\r\n\r\nIs there a way asking spack just copy the file instead using Curl to fetch a file?\r\nThanks in advance!\r\n",
