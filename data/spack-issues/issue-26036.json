    "body": "### Summary\n\nSome sites may need to add SSL certificates or other things to the beginning of the stages generated by \"spack containerize\". There are currently \"extra_instructions:build\" and \"extra_instructions:final\" options available to add extra commands at the end of each build stage. This request is asking for similar functionality for the beginning of each build stage.\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n```\r\nFROM spack/centos7:latest as builder\r\n\r\n# Beginning extra_instructions\r\nADD site_specific_cert.crt /etc/pki/ca-trust/source/anchors/site_specific_cert.crt\r\nRUN update-ca-trust\r\n\r\n# Auto-generated content by \"spack containerize\"\r\n\r\n# Ending extra_instructions\r\nRUN yum install -y libgomp\r\n\r\nENTRYPOINT [\"/bin/bash\", \"--rcfile\", \"/etc/profile\", \"-l\"]\r\n```\n\n### Rationale\n\nSome sites require a site-specific SSL certificate to be installed in order to reach upstream repos outside of the site. Without these certs in place, the \"docker build .\" fails.\n\n### Description\n\nAdd extra_instructions before the Dockerfile contents generated by Spack. Such a feature already exists for extra_instructions after the auto-generated content.\n\n### Additional information\n\nUsing spack developer brach:\r\n\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.16.2-4259-5d23638fdc\r\n\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
