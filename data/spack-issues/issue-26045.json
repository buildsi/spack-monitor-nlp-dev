    "body": "Add ILP64 support to oneapi MKL and MPI packages.\r\nAddresses issue from https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/22621#issuecomment\r\nTests are here: https://github.com/rscohn2/oneapi-spack-tests/actions/runs/1248579024\r\n\r\n@jasukhar: Can someone familiar with mkl compile/link line check the mkl changes? Spack provides  ```-I```, ```-L```, and ```-l``` options, and the user is responsible for the rest.  ```-I``` comes from the ```headers``` function. The link options come from the ```libs``` function. You specify the libraries and it generates corresponding ```-L -l```\r\n\r\n@VadimKutovoi: same for MPI\r\n\r\n",
