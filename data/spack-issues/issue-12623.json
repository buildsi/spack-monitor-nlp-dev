    "body": "Hello Spack.io\r\n\r\nThanks in advance for your great product.\r\n\r\nHowever i am struggling with mesa-glu@9.0.0%gcc@4.8.5.\r\nI'm an on a offline RHEL site locked with the default RHEL 7.6 installation. I have created a spack-mirror using a spec file where I have included the lib above.\r\nBut there seems to be a compiler diff problem: \"%gcc@:5.0.999\" conflicts with \"llvm@8:\"\r\n\r\nThe problem can be reproduced by executing following command:\r\nspack install mesa-glu@9.0.0%gcc@4.8.5\r\non a system with a gcc 4.8.5 compiler\r\n\r\nIs this a bug ? or is there a workaround ? \r\nAny help is appreciated \r\nBest regards\r\nSten\r\n",
