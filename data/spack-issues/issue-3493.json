    "body": "I followed Spack's Mirrors Guide on http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mirrors.html?highlight=mirror to configure a local mirror. After adding packages, however, curl kept complaining about failing to fetch `/spack/mirror/xxx` file which did exist there.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack mirror add local_filesystem file://~/spack/mirror\r\n```\r\n\r\nIt turned out that curl doesn't interprete `~` as `$HOME`. As a workaround, mirror path should be specified in full without `~`, for example\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack mirror add local_filesystem file:///home/rpm/spack/mirror\r\n```\r\n",
