For example, would it be possibe to change **cuda/10.1.243-gcc-4.8.5** to **cuda/10.1.243** ,  because in the strict sense cuda is not compliedd by gcc-4.8.5, the complier suffix of the module name will confuse the user.\n\n### Rationale\n\nThe develop branch spack was used\n\n### Description\n\nWould it possible to add an optional parameter to specified whether to add complier suffix in the tcl module file ?\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [ ] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
