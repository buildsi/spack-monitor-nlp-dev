    "body": "As a user of Spack I want to generate \"merged\" module files so that I can have a single module file for multiple configurations of a package with a behavior that changes according to the loaded environment.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nSpack currently maps each single concrete spec to a corresponding module file. Many sites though are used to module files that map to multiple specs and whose behavior is controlled by:\r\n\r\n- The environment variables that are set\r\n- Prerequisites modules that have been loaded already\r\n\r\nThe idea of this issue is to implement a way to generate \"merged\" module files that satisfy the use cases above.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe implementation is still to be defined. It would be probably better to collect a certain amount of use cases to drive design decisions.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n#2345 is already implementing something that goes into this direction.\r\n",
