    "body": "fixes #11983 \r\ncloses #16447\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the internal representation of `Spec` to allow for multiple dependencies or dependents stemming from the same package. This change permits to represent cases which are frequent in cross compiled environments or to bootstrap compilers.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] Substitute `DependencyMap` with `_EdgeMap`. The main differences are that the latter does not support direct item assignment and can be modified only through its API. It also provides a `select_by` method to query items.\r\n- [x] Reworked a few public APIs of `Spec` to get list of dependencies or related edges.\r\n- [x] Added unit tests to prevent regression on #11983 and prove the synthetic construction of specs with multiple deps from the same package. \r\n\r\n~Due to the change in the internal representation of specs, the YAML file for specs will change too and the \"dependencies\" field will be a list of dictionaries instead of a single dictionary:~\r\n```yaml\r\n    dependencies:\r\n      pkgconf:\r\n      - hash: nip2nwwydp6asi4iiza37drmolecwzyg\r\n        type:\r\n        - build\r\n```\r\n~This in turn will cause all of the hashes to change, so the PR is definitely not backward compatible with old installation hashes.~\r\n\r\nSince #22845 went in first, this PR reuses that format and thus it should not change hashes. What happens is that in the list of dependencies we may have the same package being present multiple times with different associated specs.\r\n\r\n",
