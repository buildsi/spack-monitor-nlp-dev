    "body": "This adds the new version v2.2.0 of the xSDK member library preCICE.\r\n\r\nThis is a new feature release, which updated the CMake C++ standard requirement to C++14 (from C++11). I updated the compiler version conflicts according to [cppreference](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/compiler_support/14). The requirements may be a bit stricter than we actually need at the moment, but should let us use any C++14 feature in the future.\r\n\r\nThis release is also the first one to support Boost 1.75.0. The previous releases (v2.1.1 or older) only work with 1.74 or older.",
