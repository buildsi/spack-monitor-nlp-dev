    "body": "This PR builds a BSD implementation of the ELF API from [elftoolchain](https://sourceforge.net/p/elftoolchain/wiki/Home/) because elfutils won't build with the Darwin system linker or with LLVM. Using a Darwin non-system linker from `binutils` is theoretically possible, but creates a bunch of linking headaches (namely, trying to debug errors with `ld: warning: file was built for archive which is not the architecture being linked (x86_64)`).\r\n\r\nRight now, the package builds and installs correctly. What I can't figure out right now is if this package provides `elf@0`, `elf@1`, or simply isn't usable by other spack packages, partly because some of the packages that depend on `elf` won't build on Darwin without a lot of effort (or at all, possibly).\r\n\r\nOnce that issue is figured out, I'll rebase to clean up the history.\r\n",
