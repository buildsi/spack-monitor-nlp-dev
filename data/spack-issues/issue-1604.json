    "body": "In the Basic Usage documentation, we use several levels of section headers. One of them in particular (`~~~~~~~~`) is not supported by Sphinx. Normally this is fine; Sphinx knows what you meant. But when you have levels below that level, Sphinx raises an error:\n\n```\nbasic_usage.rst:1269: SEVERE: Title level inconsistent:\n\nSelect module files by spec constraints\n\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\"\n```\n\nThis bug was discovered in #1576 by adding documentation testing. It will be fixed in #1576. This issue is being opened to track the problem.\n",
