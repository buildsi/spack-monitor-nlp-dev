    "body": "Since the addition of `upcxx`, **all** invocations of Spack on systems without `aprun` result in a warning message:\r\n```console\r\n==> Warning: CROSS has not been set, however cannot detect scheduler.\r\n```\r\nThis is somewhat sub-optimal to say the least, and results from the invocation of `detect_scheduler()` in order to provide the default of the `scheduler` variant, which is executed whenever the recipes are parsed.\r\n\r\nI would suggest that an alternative scheme be found to set the default and verify that the setting is valid for the current system without producing a warning on a large class of non-HPC systems.",
