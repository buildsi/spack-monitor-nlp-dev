    "body": "Make a number of changes:\r\n- Add variants for various common build flags, including support for both versions of the Racket VM environment.\r\n- Prevent `-j` flags to `make`, which has been known to cause problems with Racket builds.\r\n- Prefer the minimal release to improve install times. Bells and whistles carry their own runtime dependencies and should be installed via `raco`. An enterprising user may even create a `RacoPackage` class to make spack aware of `raco` installed packages.\r\n- Match the official version numbering scheme.\r\n\r\nDiscussed these changes with @arjunguha on Slack.",
