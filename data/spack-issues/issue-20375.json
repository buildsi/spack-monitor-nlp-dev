    "body": "I would like to see a `--verbose` flag added to `spack test run`.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nCurrently, the output of `spack test run` looks like:\r\n```\r\n$ spack test run py-setuptools\r\n==> Spack test a3k3zuqk77j6a43f3uov7cmg2f37ys4m\r\n==> Testing package py-setuptools-44.1.0-3tupt4p\r\n==> Testing package py-setuptools-50.1.0-y52kezl\r\n==> Testing package py-setuptools-50.1.0-gfu263a\r\n==> Testing package py-setuptools-50.1.0-6aovrq4\r\n==> Testing package py-setuptools-50.1.0-75gs77c\r\n==> Testing package py-setuptools-50.3.2-nvkcvji\r\n==> Testing package py-setuptools-50.3.2-pidod5m\r\n```\r\nI think by default, we should add a summary at the end, like pytest does. Something like `7 out of 7 tests PASSED`. I would also like a `--verbose` flag that shows more details of the tests for each package.",
