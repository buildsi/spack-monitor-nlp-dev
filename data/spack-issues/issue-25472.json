    "body": "Work on this wasn't properly started in this branch so far. The current useful edit is adding the minimum meson version:\r\n```\r\ndepends_on(\"meson@0.54:\", type=\"build\")\r\n```\r\nTo work, the build has to be fixed (currently the build tries to interpret system headers as some script!), and all the variants would have to be converted, and checked which versions can be supported with the Meson build.\r\nIf older versions of pango are used by users, a dual buildsystem with Meson and Autotools would be needed if the older versions don't work as `MesonPackage`.",
