    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\n\nI am not sure if this is a R problem or a general one but I only encountered it for R packages so far.\r\n\r\nIt seems that R packages which have a newer version on cran (for bioconductor I did not check) cannot be built due to missing sources. This only affects packages where the sources are not yet in the spack mirror.\r\n\r\nE.g. `r-cli`:\r\n\r\nPackage in spack: version 3.1.1\r\nnewest version on cran: 3.2.0 (see PR #29005)\r\n\r\nWhen installing\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack install r-cli\r\n==> Installing r-cli-3.1.1-xncfrt777mkotgp7lncpsf7pxrdurqjz\r\n==> No binary for r-cli-3.1.1-xncfrt777mkotgp7lncpsf7pxrdurqjz found: installing from source\r\n==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for spack-stage-r-cli-3.1.1-xncfrt777mkotgp7lncpsf7pxrdurqjz\r\n```\r\n\r\nI could reproduce this for `r-rlang` (open PR #29040).\r\n\r\nFor packages like `r-foreach` (PR #29062) where there is a newer version on cran but the old sources are already in the mirror this problem does not occur.\r\n\r\nAdditional examples:\r\n\r\nno mirror -> fail:\r\n`r-future`\r\n`r-jsonlite`\r\n`r-quantreg`\r\n`r-tinytex`\r\n`r-yaml`\r\n\r\nmirror -> work:\r\n`r-colorspace`\r\n`r-clipr`\r\n`r-crayon`\r\n`r-evaluate`\r\n`r-generics`\r\n\r\nDisabling the spack mirror results in all of these to fail as well.\r\n\r\nPossible reason:\r\nNew packages are found under in this case`https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/` and are moved to `https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/Archive/` [2] once a newer release is available. If the newest version in spack is not equal to the newest version on cran, spack looks in [1] although the sources can now only be found in [2].\r\n\r\nThis is similar to the `spack checksum` issues in #26977\r\n\r\nSide note: \r\nI found two outlier: `r-glue` and `r-mgcv`: \r\n<https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/glue_1.6.1.tar.gz> and <https://cloud.r-project.org/src/contrib/mgcv_1.8-38.tar.gz> still work although there is a newer version on cran.\r\n\r\nping @glennpj @adamjstewart @bernhardkaindl\n\n### Error message\n\n_No response_\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-1357-d62b8f0bf3\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.10\r\n* **Platform:** linux-fedora32-haswell\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
