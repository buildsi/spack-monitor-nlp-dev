    "body": "The default autoreconf method wasn't working for the `glib` package. Instead of wasting time trying to get it working, I replaced the patch to `configure.ac` with one for `configure`. Now autoreconf is no longer necessary. This also removes the need for 4 of its Autotools dependencies.\r\n\r\nThis patch was added by @mathstuf in #1529 to get `glib` to build on macOS. I confirmed that with the new patch I can build `glib` on macOS with clang. Also confirmed that this patch applies for every version of `glib` in Spack.\r\n\r\nAlso added the latest version of glib.",
