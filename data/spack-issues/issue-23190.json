    "body": "Fixes #23189 \r\n\r\nThe software tarballs for several versions of the package are known to ship with an extraneous header file -- `src/fcobjshash.h` -- that gets generated.  The work-around reported at https://gitlab.freedesktop.org/fontconfig/fontconfig/-/issues/10 is to delete the file before (re-) running configure.\r\n\r\nThis PR force-removes the file if it exists.  I have confirmed it resolves the aforementioned build issue.\r\n",
