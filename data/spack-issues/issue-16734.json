    "body": "Add ability to change the default state of Buildable to False instead of True.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nUnless you are careful and lock down your dependencies, Spack builds far too many packages (perl, tar, etc).  Users who are unfamiliar with the problem often waste hours thinking that a 2 hour library build is normal when it should be < 10 minutes. It would be nice to be able to provide a list of packages I want Spack to build instead of the opposite which is turning off the ones I don't want it to build.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n   all:\r\n    buildable: False\r\n  axom:\r\n    buildable: True\r\n  conduit:\r\n    buildable: True\r\n\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
