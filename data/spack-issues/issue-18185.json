    "body": "We've seen a lot of new packages lately using the Maven build system. This PR adds a new `MavenPackage` base class to enforce uniformity between these packages and make it easier to write new packages.\r\n\r\nAccording to https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-the-lifecycle.html#a-build-lifecycle-is-made-up-of-phases, Maven packages have a series of lifecycle phases. I tried adding all of these to the base class as separate phases, but from what I can tell it re-runs all prior stages of the lifecycle.\r\n\r\nNote that all of these packages pull in dozens to hundreds of dependencies from the internet. At some point, we should find a way to enforce offline builds and add packages for all of the dependencies, but I don't care enough about Maven to be the person to do that.\r\n\r\n@darmac I believe you added many of these packages. Can you review this PR and make sure I didn't break any packages you care about?",
