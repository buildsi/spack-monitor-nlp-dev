    "body": "Although it hurts a little: officially, *pre-compiled headers* (PCH) in boost are only supported for [gcc & msvc](http://www.boost.org/build/doc/html/bbv2/reference/precompiled_headers.html) and the latest clang release (3.9) still fails to build boost.\r\n\r\nTherefore, I disabled building those to get boost build with clang 3.9.0 on an Ubuntu 14.04 (x86).\r\n\r\nLinks to documentation and [boost bug report](https://svn.boost.org/trac/boost/ticket/12496) are inline, so people can later on check if they still apply. Seems just to be a bug in `Boost.Build` which tries to set `-o` with multiple output files during PCH install.",
