    "body": "RNPL et al. is an old package that is still used today by my collaborators, but doesn't see any development any more. I'm creating a Spack package merely to make it easier to install it on various systems. The code is not modern (C without prototypes \u2013 yes, that used to be a thing), and a large diff modernizes the code to make it palatable to modern C and Fortran compilers.\r\n\r\nRNPL contains several sub-package. The current Spack package builds only the main one.",
