    "body": "This pull request adds a new workflow to build and deploy Spack Docker containers from GitHub Actions. In comparison with our current system where we use Dockerhub's CI to build our Docker containers, this workflow will allow us to now build for multiple architectures and deploy to multiple registries. (At the moment x86_64 and Arm64 because ppc64le  is throwing an error within `archspec`.) This PR came out of a discussion with @tgamblin and @vsoch on how we might begin moving away from our reliance on DockerHub. As currently set up, the PR will build all of the current containers (minus Centos6 because those yum repositories are no longer available?) as both x86_64 and Arm64 variants. The workflow is currently setup to build and deploy containers nightly from develop as well as on tagged releases. The workflow will also build, but NOT deploy containers on a pull request for the purposes of testing this PR. At the moment it is setup to deploy the built containers to GitHub's Container Registry although, support for also uploading to Dockerhub/Quay can be included easily if we decide to keep releasing on Dockerhub/want to begin releasing on Quay. Let me know if you all have any suggestions for additional functionality!\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nAlec",
