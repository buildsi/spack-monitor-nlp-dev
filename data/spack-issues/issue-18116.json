    "body": "The current gcc recipe convolves using a Spack-built binutils with  several unrelated flags about using a\r\nstatic libstdc++ and libstdc in stage1 of the bootstrap.   This patch makes a separate variant (+static_stage1) \r\nfor those static bootstrap flags, and makes +binutils just specify an alternate \"ld\" and \"as\" from the specified\r\nbinutils.\r\n\r\n",
