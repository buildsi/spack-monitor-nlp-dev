    "body": "It's a link dep of perl, which is a build dep of cmake, and it's just annoyingly big for containers and slow to install on lustre filesystems.\r\n\r\nInstall size goes down from 100MB -> 8MB.\r\n\r\nTested it real quick, works on 6.1.29, 6.2.32, 18.1.40. Versions 18.1.32 and 6.0.35 are not available for download anymore, and 5.3.28 does not compile with GCC 10 but the patch applies alright. It's out of the scope of this PR to fix these build / download struggles.",
