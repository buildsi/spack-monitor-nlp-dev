So far I have confirmed that this will build all of the rocm packages.\r\n\r\nIs there anything here that I may be missing? The key piece here is allowing building with `mesa+llvm` where the `libllvm` provider is `llvm-amdgpu`.\r\n\r\n`gl@4.5:` is used because `gl@4.5` was what was provided by `mesa18`.",
