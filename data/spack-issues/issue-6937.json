What is the full list of supported ways of getting the mirror?\r\n\r\nDoes it support ssh? rsync? http? \r\n\r\nHow exactly should I configure the http(s) server to serve the Spack mirror? Do I need to use https://github.com/spack/spack.io ?\r\n\r\nI know I can use sshfs, but not all workstation have it (and so far `sshfs` is not among the list of supported Spack modules)",
