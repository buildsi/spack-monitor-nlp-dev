Does anyone have a work around for it?\r\n\r\n```\r\nMaking all in src\r\nmake[2]: Entering directory `/tmp/kellyt/spack-stage/spack-stage-A9wI3C/m4-1.4.18/spack-build/src'\r\n  CC       m4.o\r\n  CC       debug.o\r\n  CC       builtin.o\r\n  CC       eval.o\r\n  CC       format.o\r\n  CC       freeze.o\r\n  CC       input.o\r\n  CC       macro.o\r\n  CC       output.o\r\n  CC       path.o\r\n  CC       symtab.o\r\nclang-4.0: warning: argument unused during compilation: '-rtlib=compiler-rt' [-Wunused-command-line-argument]\r\n...\r\n  CCLD     m4\r\n/bin/ld: muloti4.c.o: access beyond end of merged section (410)\r\n/bin/ld: muloti4.c.o: access beyond end of merged section (391)\r\n/bin/ld: muloti4.c.o: access beyond end of merged section (370)\r\n/bin/ld: muloti4.c.o: access beyond end of merged section (403)\r\n/bin/ld: muloti4.c.o: access beyond end of merged section (379)\r\n/bin/ld: muloti4.c.o: access beyond end of merged section (355)\r\n/bin/ld: /scratch/kellyt/spack.20170801/opt/spack/linux-rhel7-x86_64/gcc-4.8.5/llvm-4.0.0-mdwkdc7mbn4j7rd7vwpjqbcsnikjhvim/bin/../lib/clang/4.0.0/lib/linux/libclang_rt.builtins-x86_64.a(muloti4.c.o)(.debug_info+0xe1): reloc against `.debug_loc': error 2\r\n/bin/ld: final link failed: Nonrepresentable section on output\r\nclang-4.0: error: linker command failed with exit code 1 (use -v to see invocation)\r\nmake[2]: *** [m4] Error 1\r\nmake[2]: Leaving directory `/tmp/kellyt/spack-stage/spack-stage-A9wI3C/m4-1.4.18/spack-build/src'\r\nmake[1]: *** [all-recursive] Error 1\r\nmake[1]: Leaving directory `/tmp/kellyt/spack-stage/spack-stage-A9wI3C/m4-1.4.18/spack-build'\r\nmake: *** [all] Error 2\r\n\r\n```",
