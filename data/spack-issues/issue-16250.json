    "body": "I've installed an environment that includes a view.  When I try to use `pip` from that view it fails with \r\n\r\n```\r\nImportError: No module named pkg_resources\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nI have a large Spack installation that my CI system built last night.\r\n\r\nI made a new clone of the repository and added the CI repo as an upstream (probably not important, but...).\r\n\r\nI ran `spack compiler add` to add gcc@8.4.0 to my etc/spack/compilers.yaml file for this installation, then created an environment with `spack env create --without-view ape`.\r\n\r\nI edited the `spack.yaml` to something like this (trimmed from real file):\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\n This is a Spack Environment file.\r\n #\r\n # It describes a set of packages to be installed, along with\r\n # configuration settings.\r\n spack:\r\n   include:\r\n     - /local_scratch/hartzell/spack-env-experiments/my-packages.yaml\r\n   # add package specs to the `specs` list\r\n   specs:\r\n     # many things deleted\r\n     - tmux\r\n     - tree\r\n     - vim\r\n     - wget\r\n     - zsh\r\n     - matrix:\r\n         - ['^python@2.7.16', '^python@3.7.6']\r\n         - [py-flake8, py-pip, py-virtualenv, py-setuptools]\r\n   concretization: separately\r\n   view:\r\n     the_project:\r\n       root: /tmp/moose\r\n       select:\r\n         - tmux\r\n         - py-pip^python@2.7.16\r\n         - py-setuptools^python@2.7.16\r\n         - python@2.7.16\r\n```\r\n\r\n`my-packages.yaml` sets up the compiler and java provider and then just pins versions of things that I need:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  all:\r\n    compiler: [gcc@8.4.0, gcc@4.8.5]\r\n    providers:\r\n      java: [openjdk]\r\n  aspell:\r\n    version: [0.60.6.1]\r\n  # ...\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I try to use the `pip` command from the view (e.g. to install `pipenv`), it fails.  I've tried simply putting the view's bin onto `PATH` as well as mucking about with `PYTHONPATH`.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ PATH=/tmp/moose/bin:$PATH pip install --user pipenv\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/tmp/moose/bin/pip\", line 7, in <module>\r\n    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\r\nImportError: No module named pkg_resources\r\n$ PYTHONPATH=/tmp/moose/lib/python2.7 PATH=/tmp/moose/bin:$PATH pip install --user pipenv\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/tmp/moose/bin/pip\", line 7, in <module>\r\n    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\r\nImportError: No module named pkg_resources\r\n$ PYTHONPATH=/tmp/moose/lib PATH=/tmp/moose/bin:$PATH pip install --user pipenv\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/tmp/moose/bin/pip\", line 7, in <module>\r\n    from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\r\nImportError: No module named pkg_resources\r\n$\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n<!-- If Spack reported an error, provide the error message.
