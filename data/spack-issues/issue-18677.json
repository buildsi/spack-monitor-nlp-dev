    "body": "When `spack ci rebuild` is invoked like `spack -e <path> ci rebuild`, then the subprocess launched to handle installation of dependencies from build cache is launched without awareness of the environment specified by `<path>`.\r\n\r\nOne important effect here is that if you set `mirrors:` in your `spack.yaml`, and then in your child jobs run `spack -e <path-to-env> ci rebuild`, you won't be able to install dependencies from the mirror because the installation subprocess doesn't know about the `mirrors:` defined in the Spack environment.\r\n\r\n@shahzebsiddiqui",
