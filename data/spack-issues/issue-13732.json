    "body": "At FNAL we are creating buildcaches on Jenkins servers. Keeping the private signing key on a shared Jenkins account is a security risk. Instead the buildcache are created unsigned. The following script is then used to sign the spec file after retrieval from Jenkins. This will be added as the `spack buildcache sign` subcommand.\r\n```\r\n#!/bin/sh\r\n--\r\n\u00a0\r\ngpghome=$SPACK_ROOT/opt/spack/gpg\r\n\u00a0\r\nfor bci in $*\r\ndo\r\nspecfile=`tar tvf $bci \\| grep '.spec.yaml$' \\| sed -e 's/.* //'`\r\ntar xf $bci $specfile\r\ngpg --homedir $gpghome --local-user $USER@fnal.gov --detach-sign --armor $specfile\r\ntar rf $bci $specfile.asc\r\ndone\r\n```",
