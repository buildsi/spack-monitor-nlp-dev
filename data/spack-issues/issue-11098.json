    "body": "@adamjstewart @tgamblin \r\n\r\nI have been working on putting the QMCPACK and QE Spack package into a nightly test script that runs on my Ubuntu Argonne-managed Linux box. The nightly test script runs as a user-level cronjob (not root).\r\n\r\nI have modified this script so that it works correctly in both an interactive Terminal and inside the cronjob environment. This is the modification that I had to do:\r\n`#!/bin/bash -i`\r\ninstead of\r\n`#!/bin/bash`\r\n\r\nIf the script is invoked without an interactive bash session (without the `-i`), it only works in the interactive Terminal on Ubuntu, but fails in the cronjob environment. There is a link time failure due to what appears to be mixing wrong GCC versions. Note that I am using the Intel compiler and with a very specific version of GCC. I don't see a problem with GCC compilers.\r\n\r\nI apologize if I failed Bash 101 and perhaps this is expected behaviour. At minimum, I think the behaviour should be documented here:\r\nhttps://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html\r\n\r\n[test_qmcpack_files.tar.gz](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/3039531/test_qmcpack_files.tar.gz)\r\n",
