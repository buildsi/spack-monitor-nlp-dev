    "body": "currently it requires the rsync pkg to be installed . i found that the cmakelists.txt uses hardcoded paths for rsync pkg ( /usr/bin/rsync) . i have replaced it with the rsync spack package instead and removed the references in the cmakelists.txt\r\nI have verified for the latest rocm-4.3.1 release but the changes should be valid for older releases too. hence made it applicable from 4.0.0 onwards",
