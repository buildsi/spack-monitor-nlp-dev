This was initially reported on Slack. Pinging maintainers @alalazo @tgamblin.\r\n\r\nThis should be a simple fix:\r\n```python\r\ndepends_on('py-cffi', type=('build', 'run'), when='@master+python')\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2354-9dab40dd30\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos8-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
