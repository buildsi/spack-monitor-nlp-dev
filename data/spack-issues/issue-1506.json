    "body": "Binutils provides version 2.26, but makes version 2.25 the default, with the comment \"2.26 is incompatible with py-pillow build for some reason.\".\n\nI find that Binutils 2.25 does not build LLVM on Ubuntu 16.04, while Binutils 2.26 is working fine. The problem with version 2.25 is well known; see e.g. https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=808205.\n\nIf py-pillow requires a specific version of Binutils, then it should describe this in its package.py file instead.\n",
