    "body": "This fixes #244.  @lee218llnl: can you try it out?\n\nInstead of adding conditional logic to the extended map right now, it was sufficient to modify the extension methods so that they check `spec.dependencies` to see whether the extendee is actually there.  I think this reduces the complexity of the implementation -- we just rely on all the logic that's already there to handle conditional dependencies rather than duplicating it.\n",
