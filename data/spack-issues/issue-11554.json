    "body": "The output of `spack list` should be sent to a pager if it doesn't fit on the screen.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nThe `spack list` command can produce much more output than what fits on a screen and it is inconvenient to scroll up for 20 secs. to search what you're looking for. It would be much better if  the output is sent to a pager when long enough.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCompute in some way if the output fits in the current screen, send the output to a pager if not. We might add a feature similar to [echo_via_pager](https://click.palletsprojects.com/en/7.x/api/#click.echo_via_pager) in `llnl.util.tty`.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nWe can consider using the same feature for other commands like `spack find`, `spack spec` or similar.\r\n",
