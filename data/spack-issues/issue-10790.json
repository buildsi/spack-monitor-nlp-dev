    "body": "Consider extending the `spack compiler add/find` command to include module loads in `compilers.yaml`\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nNew users value the compiler sensing capability in Spack. Taking care of loading  modules would make Spack even more useful to new users.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nFor example:\r\n\r\n`$ module load gcc/8.2.0`\r\n`$ spack compiler find`\r\n\r\ncreates a new entry in `compilers.yaml` with spec `gcc@8.2.0`.  It would be very helpful to also add `modules: gcc/8.2.0`.  \r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nIn some cases, two modules are loaded:\r\n\r\n`$ module load friendly-testing`\r\n`$ module load  modules: intel/19.0.1`\r\n\r\nHere it is necessary to include in `compilers.yaml`:\r\n```\r\nmodules:\r\n- friendly-testing\r\n- intel/19.0.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature was discussed during the Spack teleconference on 2019-02-28.",
