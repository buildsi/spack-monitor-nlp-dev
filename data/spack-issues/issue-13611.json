    "body": "#12940 changed mirrors to fetch all patches by default. This exposed problems with mirror functionality for at least mpfr.\r\n\r\nmpfr has multiple patches with the same name (`allpatches`):\r\n```python\r\n    for ver, checksum in patches.items():\r\n        patch('https://www.mpfr.org/mpfr-{0}/allpatches'.format(ver),\r\n              when='@' + ver, sha256=checksum)\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis has not caused problems in the past as long as only one version of mpfr was mirrored.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack mirror create -d $PWD/mirror mpfr@3.1.6\r\n$ spack mirror add local file://$PWD/mirror\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you switch the order of the calls, `create` will fail because it will fetch the patch for version 4.0.2 from the mirror:\r\n```\r\n==> Warning: Error while fetching mpfr@3.1.6\r\nsha256 checksum failed for .../spack-stage-yb7f7pks/allpatches\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack fetch mpfr@3.1.6\r\n==> Error: md5 checksum failed for .../spack-stage-8yao6v10/allpatches\r\nExpected 66a5d58364113a21405fc53f4a48f4e8 but got c4b23018001234d80ee3747721011162\r\n```\r\n\r\n`allpatches` in the mirror directory will actually point at the patch for version 4.0.2.\r\n\r\ncc @scheibelp",
