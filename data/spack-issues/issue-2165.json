    "body": "I'm not sure if this has already been proposed before, but I would like to be able to set variants globally. The corresponding `packages.yaml` would look like:\n\n``` yaml\npackages:\n  all:\n    variants: ~mpi~docs~gui\n```\n\nThis could be used to solve problems like #2095 and others, where a lot of users never want to build documentation or X11/GUI support.\n",
