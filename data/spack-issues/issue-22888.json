    "body": "Fixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/22813\r\n\r\nWe set `LC_ALL=C` to encourage a build process to generate ASCII output. This has generally worked but in #22813 it did not work. This reads the output of the build process in `utf-8` format which still works if the build process respects `LC_ALL` but also works if the process generates `utf-8` output.\r\n\r\nTo work with other kinds of output, we'd need to either:\r\n\r\n* allow packages to specify the encoding of text generated by the build script.\r\n* (probably better) read the output in byte format, then run encoding detection over it (this is necessary to for our output echoing logic)\r\n\r\n\r\n",
