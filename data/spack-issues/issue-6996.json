    "body": "While reviewing #6884 I noticed that the PR at 2aaf758083a7c9dc799ef38f4f237b7a6dc27cf7 produced a wrong graph for `trilinos`. Anyhow it passes all unit tests.\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\nA failure of some of the concretization unit tests\r\n\r\n### Actual Result\r\n\r\nAll tests pass\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nSo far I have been unable to reduce the issue to a minimal graph. Anyhow running:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack graph -d trilinos > trilinos.dot\r\n```\r\non the PR and visualizing the result, it can be seen that `parmetis` has no dependencies (which is clearly wrong). The output file is reported here for convenience [trilinos.pr6884.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/1646552/trilinos.pr6884.txt) and can be visualized by cutting and pasting its content [here](http://www.webgraphviz.com/).\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nI ran on:\r\n```console\r\n$ uname -a\r\nLinux nuvolari 4.4.0-109-generic #132~14.04.1-Ubuntu SMP Tue Jan 9 21:46:42 UTC 2018 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux\r\n```\r\nbut I expect the same issue to be present on other platforms.",
