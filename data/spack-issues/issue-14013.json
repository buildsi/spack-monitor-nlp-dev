Unlike most other viewers, it does not have a fancy GUI, but simply displays images. It is controlled via commandline arguments and configurable key/mouse actions.\r\n\r\n### Supporting Packages\r\n* **imlib2**: Library that does image file loading and saving as well as rendering, manipulation, arbitrary polygon support\r\n* **libexif**: A library to parse an EXIF file and read the data from those tags\r\n* **libid3tag**: library for id3 tagging\r\n\r\n---\r\nIf need be I can resubmit this as 4 separate Pull Requests but as the 3 extra packages are just to support the topic of this PR (feh), I decided to submit one request that includes all 4 packages.",
