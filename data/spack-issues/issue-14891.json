    "body": "The previous incantation for QT platform detection worked for QT5 linux clang (see https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/13650) but apparently not for QT4 linux clang. I can now successfully compile QT 4.8.7 with clang 9, gcc 8, or intel 18 on linux.\r\n\r\nI've also marked myself as a maintainer of QT since I have to deal with this \ud83d\udca9 package so much.",
