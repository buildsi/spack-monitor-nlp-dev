    "body": "closes #28829\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a new check to `spack audit configs`. This will help diagnosing issues like in #28829 where a custom user configuration containing deprecated, non-buildable external specs was driving clingo towards DAGs that would not use them.\r\n\r\nUsing the command with the `spack.yaml` from the issue returns:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack -e . audit configs \r\nCFG-COMPILER: 0 issues found.\r\nCFG-PACKAGES: 2 issues found\r\n1. The external spec \"libtool\" is not buildable and contains deprecated versions. This can cause unexpected optimal configurations from clingo.\r\n    \"libtool@2.4.2\" is a deprecated version, consider removing it\r\n2. The external spec \"openssl\" is not buildable and contains deprecated versions. This can cause unexpected optimal configurations from clingo.\r\n    \"openssl@1.0.2k\" is a deprecated version, consider removing it\r\n```",
