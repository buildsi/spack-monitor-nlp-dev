I'm using an all-spack build, that\r\nis no `packages.yaml` for any external packages, and not using `/opt/rocm`.\r\n\r\nIndeed, `CMakelists.txt` in hsa-rocr-dev has:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  95 ## Find external dependencies.\r\n  96 find_package(LibElf REQUIRED)\r\n  97 find_package(hsakmt 1.0 REQUIRED HINTS ${CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX} PATHS /opt/rocm)\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd `/opt/rocm` has this in `hsakmt-config-version.cmake` which is certainly > 1.0:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset(PACKAGE_VERSION \"20210902.12.3277-mainline-20210902-12-g3277d53\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut if you build `hsakmt-roct` from scratch in spack, you get this which is < 1.0:\r\n\r\n```\r\nset(PACKAGE_VERSION \"0.11.2-16011-g186730a284\")\r\n```\r\n\r\nSo, it looks to me that you can't build hip or hsa-rocr-dev from\r\nscratch in spack.\r\n\r\nThoughts on the best way to fix this?\r\nPatch the CMakeLists.txt test?\r\nPatch the hsakmt-config-version.cmake file?\r\n\r\nThis is more than the most recent 4.5.2, it's also a problem in 4.3.1\r\nand probably several (all?) revs earlier.\r\n\r\n\n\n### Error message\n\n<details><summary>Error message</summary><pre>\r\n...\r\n</pre></details>\r\n\n\n### Information on your system\n\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.11.2-16011-186730a284\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
