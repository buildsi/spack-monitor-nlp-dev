    "body": "Adds a package for the `cvxopt` convex optimization solver. Passes all tests with and without optional dependencies on macOS 10.13.3 with Clang 9.0.0.\r\n\r\nI didn't add a package for Mosek because it's proprietary and I couldn't figure out how to get it to build. Conda builds Mosek, so it should be doable. Can anyone find Conda's build recipe for Mosek?\r\n\r\nDepends on #7526 (which has now been merged).",
