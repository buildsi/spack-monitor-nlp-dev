    "body": "Still a work in progress. I'm working out some bugs in the build system. RPATHs don't seem to be working properly, although you can set them as environment variables if you need to.\r\n\r\nWe may want to hold off on merging this one until after we get better support for EULAs. In order to download this package, you have to read through the EULA and click agree, then you are presented with the download link.\r\n\r\nLet me know if you find anything obviously wrong with this package. I suspect it will be of interest to @citibeth ",
