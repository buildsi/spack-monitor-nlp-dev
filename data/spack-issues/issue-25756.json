This makes it incompatible with manylinux generated extensions for `ppc64le`.\r\n\r\nTo fix this issue when bootstrapping Spack we generate on-the-fly symbolic links to the name expected by the current interpreter if different from the default expectation of CPython.\r\n\r\nLinks:\r\n-  https://github.com/pypa/manylinux/issues/687\r\n- https://src.fedoraproject.org/fork/churchyard/rpms/python3/blame/00274-fix-arch-names.patch?identifier=test_email-mktime",
