This commit removes the Boost.with_default_variants to variants that packages are precisely dependent upon through build analysis conducted under @trws. This is the second batch of 20 packages with updated boost dependencies.\r\n\r\nThe focus of this PR is the commit (1e8a18d) as the rest are being reviewed under dependent PRs.",
