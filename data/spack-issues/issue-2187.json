    "body": "Fixes #2182.\r\n\r\n- Detailed debug information is now handed back to the parent process\r\n  from builds, for *any* type of exception.\r\n\r\n- previously this only worked for Spack ProcessErrors, but now it works\r\n  for any type of error raised in a child.\r\n\r\n- Spack will print an error message and source code context for build\r\n  errors by default.\r\n\r\n- It will print a stack trace when using `spack -d`, even when the error\r\n  occurred in the child process.",
