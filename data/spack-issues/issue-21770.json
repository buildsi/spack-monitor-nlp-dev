    "body": "BlasPP by ECP SLATE will fail to install by default (`spack install blaspp`) because\r\n- the default BLAS installation in Spack is OpenBLAS\r\n- BlasPP conflicts with `threads=none` for all recent OpenBLAS releases\r\n\r\nLuckily, for OpenBLAS itself introduced a threadsafe compile option with 0.3.7+ aka `USE_LOCKING`:\r\n```\r\n   61 # If you want to build a single-threaded OpenBLAS, but expect to call this\r\n   62 # from several concurrent threads in some other program, comment this in for\r\n   63 # thread safety. (This is done automatically for USE_THREAD=1 , and should not\r\n   64 # be necessary when USE_OPENMP=1)\r\n   65 # USE_LOCKING = 1\r\n```\r\n\r\nAccording to my tests, with `spack install --test root blaspp`, this exactly addresses the issues in BlasPP tests.\r\n\r\nIt also seems to be a good option to set by default for OpenBLAS and users that do not need this safety net can always disable it.\r\n\r\ncc @G-Ragghianti @mgates3\r\n\r\nFollow-up to #20956",
