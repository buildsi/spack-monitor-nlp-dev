    "body": "The changes in this pull request fix a bug in the `py-matplotlib` package that was causing builds with C-specific flags (e.g. `-std=c11`) to fail due to being used to compile C++ files. I've verified that the `py-matplotlib@1.5.3` variant compiles in the `clang%9.0.0 arch=linux-rhel7-power9le` build environment.\r\n\r\nAs an aside, I'm not thrilled with this fix as it feels very kludgey, but I'm unaware of an alternative for setting the compiler used during the `setup.py` build phase. If there are less clumsy alternatives, please let me know.",
