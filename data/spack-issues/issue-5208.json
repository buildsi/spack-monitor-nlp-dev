    "body": "Spack supports and invokes parallel make, which is great. But, sometimes I'd like it to be _nicer_ about how much of a login node I am taking on a machine and, when doing long builds, have it throttle itself so as not to be too much of a resource hog. Make has the ability to specify a load average threshold...\r\n\r\n```\r\n  -l [N], --load-average[=N], --max-load[=N]\r\n                              Don't start multiple jobs unless load is below N.\r\n```\r\n\r\nabove which, it will not start new jobs.\r\n\r\nIs this something that Spack could be enhanced to pass on to make?",
