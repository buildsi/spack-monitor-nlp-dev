    "body": "Disclaimer: I am using Spack pipeline feature in a context that is different than the one in Spack CI. I run CI on a cluster, where runners consist in shells instances that run as me. The file system is shared.\r\n\r\nBug: The current implementation does not support the case where the environment file (`spack.yaml`) includes another file, like `compiler.yaml` or `packages.yaml`.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nWrite a spack pipeline with a `spack.yaml` that has includes in it.\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nThe included files will not be detected and added to the artifact. This is impacting:\r\n- at generation level -> the jobs will not be able to run without those files.\r\n- at reproducibility level -> the jobs will not be reproducible without those files. \r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-3158-8b75e81666\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.2\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-broadwell\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n@scottwittenburg ",
