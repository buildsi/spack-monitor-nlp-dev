    "body": "If the spack install command specifies cflags (either on the command line or in `compilers.yaml`), tell CMake to use only spack's cflags and none of its own default values.\r\n\r\nfixes #6839\r\n\r\nThe downside to this approach is that if cflags is set, then setting `build_type=<whatever>` might not do what is expected because the cflags will trump cmake's build_type default compiler flags.",
