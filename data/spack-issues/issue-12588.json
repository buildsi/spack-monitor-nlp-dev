    "body": "Fixes #12304 (awaiting confirmation from @bartlettroscoe)\r\n\r\nPreviously, `libxml2` declared a dependency on `libiconv` but did not tell its build system where to find the Spack-built `libiconv`. This caused the build system to find a system `libiconv`, and caused `libtool` to put a bare `-liconv` option into the `libxml2.la` file. This was then propagated to the link lines of other libraries depending on `libxml2`, and caused build failures. I believe the exact failure mode related to how MPI implementations use libtool to generate flags for their compiler wrappers.\r\n\r\nWith this PR, the `libxml2.la` file has a fully qualified path to `libiconv.la`, and I believe this should fix all related issues.",
