    "body": "This PR adds interproscan-4.8, which has a completely different build\r\nsystem than version 5. Note that this builds for running on a host as\r\nopposed to a queue system. I am fairly certain that a queue system can\r\nbe configured later.\r\n\r\nThis PR also adds a patch for intrproscan-5 to build when the user\r\nbuilding the packages has a large GID by setting posix mode for tar.",
