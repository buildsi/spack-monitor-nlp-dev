    "body": "<!--*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*-->\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nLooking for ways to reduce compile and loading time.  Right now spack has it's own caching system, but this doesn't allow for distributed compiles or caching downloads with appllications outside of spack.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nIt should be pretty straightforward to get the underlying spack downloads and compiles to be done via distcc and squid.  It looks like a configuration issue that requires minimal code changes.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nThis might be something someone has already done.\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [ X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [ X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n",
