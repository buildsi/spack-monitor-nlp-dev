Also enable this feature in python so that one can do\r\n```python\r\nimport sqlite3\r\ncon = sqlite3.connect(\":memory:\")\r\n# enable extension loading\r\ncon.enable_load_extension(True)\r\n```\r\nIf not compiled with this option, the last line throws errors.\r\n\r\nRefs:\r\n\r\n- https://docs.python.org/3.8/library/sqlite3.html#f1\r\n- https://www.sqlite.org/loadext.html\r\n\r\nNote that footnotes in 1st Ref above doesn't apply here since spack compiles SQLite from scratch",
