We just don't want to release a version 3.0 and figure out a month later that a breaking change is required.\r\n\r\n### Reasons for submitting 4 packages \r\n- split packages to have minimal dependencies (especially for py-damask, which would even run on Windows)\r\n- metapackage (BundledPackage) to get everything together\r\n- the same structure is used for [deb](https://launchpad.net/~eisenforschung/+archive/ubuntu/damask), [rpm](https://build.opensuse.org/repositories/home:MarDieh/damask), [Conda](https://github.com/conda-forge/damask-feedstock), and pacman (under development).\r\n",
