    "body": "One question related to `PythonPackage`'s.\r\n\r\nI've seen this piece of code inside the `setup.py` of a python package:\r\n\r\n```\r\nsetuptools_args = {}\r\ninstall_requires = setuptools_args['install_requires'] = [\r\n    'traitlets',\r\n    'ipython_genutils',\r\n    'jupyter_core',\r\n    'jupyter_client>=4.1',\r\n    'pygments',\r\n    'ipykernel>=4.1', # not a real dependency, but require the reference kernel\r\n]\r\n```\r\n\r\nDo I have to define all these other python packages as a dependency in the `package.py` or is it enough just defining `py-setuptools` as a dependency to install these requirements? In the latter case, I guess that at least I have to check that all these packages (traitlets, ipython_genutils,...) are supported by Spack.",
