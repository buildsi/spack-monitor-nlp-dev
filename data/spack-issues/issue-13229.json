    "body": "A developer should be able to use the `-d` option when running spack tests but the `test_changed_files` test has been failing with `spack: error: unrecognized arguments: -d` (for me) if it is used.  \r\n\r\nYou can quickly reproduce the issue by entering `spack -d test -k test_changed_files`.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the offending test case so it uses only the flake8 defaults (rather than picking up arguments from the spack command line).",
