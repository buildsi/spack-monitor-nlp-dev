    "body": "Recently (#8102), libjpeg-turbo started building libraries to lib64 instead of lib on my machine.\r\n\r\nI believe this is the culprit (in opencv's package.py):\r\n```\r\n        if '+jpeg' in spec:\r\n            libjpeg = spec['jpeg']\r\n            args.extend([\r\n                '-DBUILD_JPEG:BOOL=OFF',\r\n                '-DJPEG_LIBRARY:FILEPATH={0}'.format(\r\n                    join_path(libjpeg.prefix.lib,\r\n                              'libjpeg.{0}'.format(dso_suffix))),\r\n                '-DJPEG_INCLUDE_DIR:PATH={0}'.format(libjpeg.prefix.include)\r\n            ])\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis does not consider the possibility that the path should be `libjpeg.prefix.lib64`.\r\n\r\nI'm currently manually symlinking lib64/libjpeg.so to lib/libjpeg.so, as a stopgap.\r\n\r\n * Does `libjpeg.prefix.lib64` exist, in the context above? Can it? Should it?\r\n * Is there some way to get libjpeg-turbo to install to lib instead of lib64? None of the changes in libjpeg-turbo stood out as the reason it changed directories.",
