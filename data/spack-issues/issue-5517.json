    "body": "Hi,\r\nI didn't realize the previous SPACK version I was working on is not the latest one. \r\nI have pulled the SPACK again, and there should be no merge conflicts now. \r\nPlease use the latest version of SZ instead in your package. \r\nWe added the executable (called sz) in the new version, and also fixed some bugs. \r\n\r\nThanks.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSheng ",
