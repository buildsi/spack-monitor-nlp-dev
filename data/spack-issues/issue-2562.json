    "body": "Prepare for #2475.\r\n\r\nThis adds a check that runs Spack startup on macOS to compensate for `git` not properly changing names of files with mixed case.  At first I thought this was an issue with my using the `mv` from `coreutils` instead of `/bin/mv`, but I tested both ways and it seems `git` just doesn't handle case-only changes properly on macs.\r\n\r\nThis will do a `git ls-tree` on `var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/`, and it will do a case-restoring double rename (e.g., `mv foo tmp; mv tmp FOO`) on any packages that don't match what `git` thinks they should be called.  Note that we don't do anything for external packages, as we're only really enforcing lowercase for `builtin` packages.\r\n\r\nThis will make #2475 and other such changes non-disruptive.  Without it, users will have to do double moves on every package each time they switch to/from a branch with #2475 merged.",
