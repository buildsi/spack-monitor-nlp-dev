    "body": "This PR prevents an `IndexError: pop from empty list` in `version.py`, thereby allowing processing to proceed. (Note that this PR does NOT address the fetch issue in the  `cudnn` package that occurs after version processing.)\r\n\r\nMotivation:\r\nThere was an issue reported in the packaging slack channel that I could reproduce with the following:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack -d install cudnn@7.1\r\n...\r\n  File \"/usr/WS1/dahlgren/releases/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/cudnn/package.py\", line 222, in url_for_version\r\n    elif version >= Version('7.0'):\r\n  File \"/usr/WS1/dahlgren/releases/spack/lib/spack/spack/version.py\", line 304, in __getitem__\r\n    string_arg.pop()  # We don't need the last separator\r\nIndexError: pop from empty list\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe install process proceeds with the fix BUT does not complete successfully but as follows:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack install cudnn@7.1\r\n==> Warning: gcc@8.3.1 cannot build optimized binaries for \"cascadelake\". Using best target possible: \"skylake_avx512\"\r\n==> Warning: Missing a source id for cudnn@7.1\r\n==> Installing cudnn-7.1-mcpbvxsum7p2g3nk2fudvov3pywpzmo6\r\n==> No binary for cudnn-7.1-mcpbvxsum7p2g3nk2fudvov3pywpzmo6 found: installing from source\r\n==> Warning: There is no checksum on file to fetch cudnn@7.1 safely.\r\n==>   Fetch anyway? [y/N] y\r\n==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed\r\n\r\n/usr/WS1/dahlgren/releases/spack/lib/spack/spack/package.py:1376, in do_fetch:\r\n       1373\r\n       1374        self.stage.create()\r\n       1375        err_msg = None if not self.manual_download else self.download_instr\r\n  >>   1376        start_time = time.time()\r\n       1377        self.stage.fetch(mirror_only, err_msg=err_msg)\r\n       1378        self._fetch_time = time.time() - start_time\r\n       1379\r\n```",
