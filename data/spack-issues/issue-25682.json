Unfortunately the PyPI tarball doesn't have the necessary file, so we have to build from a GitHub tarball.\r\n\r\nStill haven't figured out how to build `py-flit` from source without setuptools. I think we need to implement PEP-517 support at some point. I would rather avoid using `pip` for everything.",
