    "body": "Python will look to link with libncursesw in preference to libncurses. Since\nncurses in spack is built without suffixes there is no libncursesw and\npython will link to the system libncursesw for _curses.so and\n_curses_panel.so, as well as libpanelw for _curses_panel.so.\n\nThis PR introduces a patch that simple removes the check for ncursesw in\nsetup.py and therefore sets `curses_library` to `ncurses`.\n\nAn alternative solution would be to have the ncurses package build the suffixed versions as well as the non-suffixed versions.\n",
