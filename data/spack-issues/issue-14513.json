    "body": "When installed, Python packages have the typical structure with `include`, `lib`, and `bin` folders. When loaded by spack, their `include` directory is added to the CPATH environment  variable. Most python packages do not expose C headers. However, python packages that do have headers will often install them in `include/pythonX` (where X is the python version), rather than in `include` (for instance on my machine with Python 3.6.8 they are installed in `include/python3.6m`). Hence any code that requires these headers will need to `#include <python3.6m/path/to/the/header.h>` (so we should know ahead of time the python version) instead of simply `#include <path/to/the/header.h>`, OR it should figure out the header path by a means other than simply relying on CPATH.\r\n\r\nIt would be good, when loading a Python package, that its `include/pythonX` also be added to CPATH (with X being replaced appropriately).",
