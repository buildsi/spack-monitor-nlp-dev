On systems that don't have the OS packages installed, this leads to failures during the build [e.g. this comment in 01482](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/10482#issuecomment-488786745).\r\n\r\nThis fixes it.  Tested on a minimally provisioned CentOS 7.\r\n\r\n@opadron, can you check it on your systems (I'm using the same base system that @odoublewen is, but I'm sure he'll test it too...).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
