    "body": "This replaces modules.py current variable substitution with calls to spec.format. The goal is to use the same approach where possible so users do not need to learn multiple substitution formats. This includes:\n- generation of module file names\n- generation of environment variable names and values\n\nThis also includes the addition of 2 fields to spec.format: prefix and hash. \n",
