    "body": "This is a placeholder issue to document the current status, but does not immediately result in a solution.\r\n\r\nCreating a module for OpenFOAM within spack is at the moment a bit difficult.\r\nPopulating the `setup_environment` manually with environment variables is cumbersome, error-prone and *very* large. Using the `EnvironmentModifications.from_sourcing_files` seems to partly work, but can have issues if with the python versions or other things. Most of the module content seems to be generated before the software comes into its final installation directory, which makes other scripting solutions a bit of a problem too.\r\n\r\nWe currently have a [script to created a module include](https://develop.openfoam.com/Community/feature-scripts) from the OpenFOAM environment, but this is only a manual workaround.",
