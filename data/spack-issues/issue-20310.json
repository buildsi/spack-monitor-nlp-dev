I get the error message below.\r\n\r\nI discussed the issue with @becker33, and he says it looks like there is a bug in the dyninst package and the elf providers, so it fails if there is a dependance on dyninst and elf. It looks like the error is releated to `elfutils`.\r\n\r\nThe error does not show up in Spack v0.15.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nInstall Spack, and checkout v0.16\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install callpath\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n```console\r\nError: '<' not supported between instances of 'str' and 'NoneType'\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nI run on CentOS 7.\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first.
