    "body": "@eugeneswalker pointed out that many common CUDA architectures, like Tesla K80 (3.7) weren't supported by our CudaPackage base class. This PR adds all possible CUDA architectures and more specific supported versions of CUDA.\r\n\r\nI wasn't sure what to do about older versions of CUDA and compiler conflicts. Maybe @ax3l can point me in the right direction? It seems like info for older versions of CUDA is sparse though. I feel like a lot of this compiler conflict stuff should actually be moved to the `cuda` package, not this base class. Thoughts?\r\n\r\nP.S. Is anyone interested in being an official maintainer for `CudaPackage`? I think it would be overridden by any package that extends this base class and sets `maintainers`, but it would be nice to have someone official to manage this stuff.\r\n\r\n@svenevs may also be interested in this.",
