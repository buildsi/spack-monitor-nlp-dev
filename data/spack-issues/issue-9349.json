    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nIn the documentation (https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_yaml.html), both `directory_layout` and `install_path_scheme` appear but as far as I can tell only the latter is actually used in the source code.\r\n\r\nAs `directory_layout` is part of the default `config.yaml` file, my guess is that it might be a leftover from a name change.\r\n\r\nCan someone clarify this?\r\n\r\nBest regards,\r\nR\u00e9mi",
