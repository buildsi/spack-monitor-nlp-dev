    "body": "**This needs feedback**, see my questions below (thanks!)\n\nAdd perl package, based on [work by justintoo](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/105).  He had too many things lumped into his pull request, this just adds a perl package.\n\nW.r.t. extentions: I need to understand Spack's extension mechanism and see if it makes sense for Perl.\n\nThis supports the current releases on the past three minor branches.\n\nIt runs perl's tests before installing.\n\nIt installs cpanm alongside the core (which makes building on top of this perl _much_ simpler).  Can be disabled via a variant.\n\n_Questions:_\n1. This is my first crack at a \"new\" (though based on other work) package file.  What does it need in the header/comments.\n2. I want to install a known version of App::cpanminus alongside the core.  I've currently hardcoded the version.  I thought I could use a non-boolean variant, but that change looks like it's still waiting to be merged.  Do I have other alternatives?\n3. Running perl's tests takes a while, but it's the only real way to know if you have a functional build (until I added it, I thought that 5.18.4 was working; turns out that release won't build w/ gcc 5...).  Is there a tradition around enabling \"fast\" or \"skip the tests\" builds that I should follow?\n",
