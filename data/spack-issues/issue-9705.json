    "body": "v0.35.0 of py-numba (which is the only version listed in package.py) won't build against Python 3.7.x due to apparent API changes in Python.  (This appears to be similar to #9677, although the actual error messages are different.)  There is a newer version of numba available that does build against 3.7.x.\r\n\r\nThe fix is to add the new numba version and then appropriate `depends_on('python@...)` calls for each version.  Pull request will be coming shortly.",
