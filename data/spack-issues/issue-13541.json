The heart of this issue is that the ordering does not seem to be guaranteed.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack -d --stacktrace mirror list\r\n```\r\n```\r\nlib/spack/spack/config.py:706 ==> [2019-11-01-19:19:21.680016] Reading config file /opt/spack/etc/spack/defaults/modules.yaml\r\nlib/spack/spack/config.py:706 ==> [2019-11-01-19:19:21.716634] Reading config file /opt/spack/etc/spack/defaults/linux/modules.yaml\r\nlib/spack/spack/config.py:706 ==> [2019-11-01-19:19:21.740597] Reading config file /root/.spack/modules.yaml\r\nlib/spack/spack/config.py:706 ==> [2019-11-01-19:19:21.765068] Reading config file /opt/spack/etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml\r\nlib/spack/spack/cmd/__init__.py:102 ==> [2019-11-01-19:19:21.809276] Imported mirror from built-in commands\r\nlib/spack/spack/cmd/__init__.py:102 ==> [2019-11-01-19:19:21.816516] Imported mirror from built-in commands\r\nlib/spack/spack/config.py:706 ==> [2019-11-01-19:19:21.897826] Reading config file /root/.spack/mirrors.yaml\r\nsecond    http://2\r\nthird     http://3\r\nfirst     http://1\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis output observed while running the Spack `centos7` docker image on Docker for Mac.",
