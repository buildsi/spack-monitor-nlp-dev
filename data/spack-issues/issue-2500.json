    "body": "Allows users to use `spack compiler find` to add compilers for the same platform/os but different targets when spack is installed on a file system mounted on machines with different targets.\r\n\r\nThe default behavior of operating systems will be to assume all compilers it can find are for the target on which it is executing. The cray backend operating system will use the keyword 'any', as the cray targeting system is dependent on targeting modules to change the behavior of the same compiler wrapper. No other operating systems currently differ from the default compiler find behavior, so no other changes should be necessary.",
