Without explicit control, those dependencies might get picked up from the system environment and will cause unstable builds.\r\n\r\nAdd a newer release of DataSpaces (1.8.0) for ADIOS2. Also add missing `-fPIC` flags since this is a static library.\r\n\r\nMentioned in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/13220#issuecomment-542380335\r\n\r\ncc @williamfgc @chuckatkins @philip-davis",
