    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nFixed the location of charmrun during namd compilation.\r\n\r\nNamd used to fail because it was looking for charmrun in $(CHARMBASE)/$(CHARMARCH) while with current charmpp setup it is in spec['charmpp'].prefix:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmake: *** No rule to make target \r\n'/home/nikolays/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake_avx512/gcc-10.2.0/\r\ncharmpp-6.10.2-mf5vqdyi3q7mzqiofevjf42fehcuwvwv/netlrts-linux-x86_64/bin/charmrun', \r\nneeded by 'charmrun'.  Stop. \r\n```\r\n\r\nI am not sure is charm++ architecture is now per one installed package or it still can combine multiple within single installed package. So  I added conditional patching if there is no spec['charmpp'].charmarch in spec['charmpp'].prefix then set CHARM to $(CHARMBASE) in Make.config.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nNikolay",
