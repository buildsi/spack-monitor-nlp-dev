If it did not report an error but the output appears incorrect, provide the incorrect output. If there was no error message and no output but the result is incorrect, describe how it does not match what you expect. -->\r\n```console\r\n$ which python\r\n$ echo $CUDA_ROOT\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf you don't have python as a root package, you will not see it in the path.  If you don't have cuda as a root package it will not setup the correct shell environment variables.\r\n",
