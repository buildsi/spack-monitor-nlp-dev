    "body": "There's a test that started failing consistently around yesterday on MacOS. The issue is a `git diff` command that can't find the merge base to compute the list of files which changed in a PR:\r\n```console\r\n'/usr/local/bin/git' 'diff' '--name-only' '--diff-filter=ACMR' 'develop...'\r\nfatal: develop...HEAD: no merge base\r\n```\r\nOddly enough the same command succeeds on linux for the same merge commit and repository. An example of a failure can be found [here](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/17732/checks?check_run_id=919374994).",
