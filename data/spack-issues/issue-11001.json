    "body": "I am trying to set a systemwide preference for building `gdb` with `python3` as the python provider.  However, setting the concretization preference in the `etc/spack/packages.yaml file has no effect. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nI can obviously achieve the stated goal on the command line with `spack install gdb ^python@3.7.2`. That works fine.\r\n\r\nHowever, setting it in the `etc/spack/packages.yaml` file has no effect. \r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  gdb:\r\n    variants: ^python@3.7.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that setting other concretization preferences (like -xz) in `variants` works.\r\nI also tried to set `providers` but this has no effect either (and if I understand correctly this is normal).\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n`gdb@8.2.0^python@2.7.16` is produced instead of `gdb@8.2.0^python@3.7.2`\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n 1. Scientific Linux 7\r\n 2. ~~any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.)~~ see above\r\n",
