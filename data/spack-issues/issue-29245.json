    "body": "### Summary\n\nThe netcdf-cxx package configuration is quite different from netcdf-fortran, although both are from the same organization and build on the same netcdf-c library. The netcdf-fortran package seems to be maintained and used more, therefore I am suggesting to align the netcdf-cxx4 package (default options etc.) with the netcdf-fortran package.\n\n### Rationale\n\nBeing consistent in how options/variants are named and what the default is makes it easier for developers and users.\n\n### Description\n\nThe idea is to adopt the defaults from netcdf-fortran and apply them to netcdf-cxx4, where applicable.\n\n### Additional information\n\n> spack --version\r\n0.17.1-1369-c8e170b862\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
