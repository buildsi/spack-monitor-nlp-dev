    "body": "Fixes #13415.\r\n\r\nPreviously, spack would error out if we tried to fetch something with no code, but that would prevent fetching dependencies. In particular, this would fail:\r\n\r\n    spack fetch --dependencies xsdk\r\n\r\n- [x] Instead of raising an error, just print a message that there is nothing\r\n      to be fetched for packages like xsdk that do not have code.\r\n\r\n- [x] Make BundleFetchStrategy a bit more quiet about doing nothing.",
