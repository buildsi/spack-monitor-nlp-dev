    "body": "This PR has three things\r\n\r\n1. Built extra tools, namely inits and ring. Both needed for simulations.\r\n2. Added optimization flag many new compilers do not produce stable code. I.e. with high and aggressive optimization some things diverges.\r\n  *. In my test case gcc 9.3 and 10.2 failed to complete simulation if compiled with high or aggressive optimization\r\n3. A fix for compiling with gcc 10.2 fix, original error message:\r\n```\r\nError: Type mismatch in argument 'ispec' at (1); passed INTEGER(4) to INTEGER(8)\r\n```\r\n\r\n-Nikolay",
