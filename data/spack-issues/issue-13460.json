    "body": "+ It appears that macOS related changes to the gcc recipe (PR #13202) broke gcc on RHEL7.  This bug manifests as `libstdc++.so: undefined reference to libiconv` when gcc is used.\r\n+ Fixes #13452 by moving `--with-libiconv-prefix={0}'.format(spec['libiconv'].prefix)` into the darwin OS section of the configuration.\r\n+ Also fixes #13391\r\n+ Needs to be tested on macOS and other Linux flavors.",
