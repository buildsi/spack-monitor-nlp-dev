    "body": "This PR updates the ADIOS package.\n\n**Changes:**\n- add latest stable release `1.10.0`\n- add previous versions (hashes)\n- add default license header\n- add build options (shamelessly taken from HDF5 package)\n- add validation for excisting FC (as in HDF5) and make optional\n- handle mxml dependency correctly (not required in 1.10.0+)\n- add `CFLAGS=-fPIC` to build shared (python) libs in ADIOS' lib\n- remove `-DMPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK` since it is ~~normally~~ afaik not required\n- remove `MPICC/CXX/FC` since `--with-mpi` just performs well\n- add transforms:\n  - `zlib`: useful (optional) default\n  - `szip`: optional (compile often broken)\n- add transports that are not as performant as the `.bp` format:\n  - `hdf5`: non-default\n  - `netcdf`: non-default, close #1610\n",
