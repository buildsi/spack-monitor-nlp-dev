Thanks in advance!\r\n\r\nIn case it works, I will take care of opening a PR also in neovim package (for the USE_BUNDLED use-case) and/or the maintainer of this package ([leonerd](https://github.com/leonerd)) in case there is any way to patch the project (from latest info it seems it has been deprecated, see https://github.com/neovim/libtermkey).",
