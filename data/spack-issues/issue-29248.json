Concretization comes down to picking an optimal element from the subspace of abstract input specs.\r\n\r\nThen `x.satisfies(y, strict=False)` _should_ be defined as `x` and `y` have a non-empty intersection, i.e. `x \u2229 y \u2260 \u2205`.\r\n\r\nand similarly `x.satisfies(y, strict=True) `_should_ be defined as `x` is a subset of `y`, i.e. `x \u2286 y`.\r\n\r\nHowever, they don't behave in this way currently.\r\n\r\n- Not all `satisfy` methods implement `strict=True/False`:\r\n- `Version.satisfies` is not commutative, but it should\r\n   ```python\r\n   >>> spack.version.ver('3.8.1').satisfies(spack.version.ver('3.8'))\r\n   True\r\n   >>> spack.version.ver('3.8').satisfies(spack.version.ver('3.8.1'))\r\n   False\r\n   ```\r\n   This should be `False` in both cases, since these are concrete versions i.e. singletons and not equal.\r\n- `VersionRange.satisfies` is not commutative (fixed in #29209)\r\n\r\nI think Spack would be much easier to follow if these concepts were formalized as above, so they don't leave room for discussion or interpretation.",
