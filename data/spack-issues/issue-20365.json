    "body": "Add new package : PFAPACK\r\nA library for numerically computing the Pfaffian of a real or complex skew-symmetric matrix. This is based on computing the tridiagonal form of the matrix under unitary congruence transformations.\r\nThe theory behind the implementation is explained in ACM Trans. Math. Software 38 30 (2012) (also on arxiv). Please cite this paper if you use the PFAPACK library in your work.\r\n\r\nACM Trans. : http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2331138\r\narxiv : http://arxiv.org/abs/1102.3440",
