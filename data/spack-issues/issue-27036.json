    "body": "I updated the VisIt package to build with 3.2.1.\r\n\r\nIt includes several several patches to vtk 8.1 for building on a system with no system install X11 libraries or include files.\r\n\r\nIt specifies specific versions of dependent packages that are known to work with 3.2.1.\r\n\r\nIt was tested on spock.olcf.ornl.gov. The GUI came up and rendered images and an image was successfully saved using off screen rendering from data from curv2d.silo.\r\n\r\nI had to make some changes to my environment on spock to get the spack package to work properly.\r\n\r\nFor pcre to build, I had to do:\r\n\r\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH=/opt/cray/pe/gcc/10.3.0/snos/lib64:/opt/cray/libfabric/1.11.0.4.75/lib64\r\n\r\nI also had to change:\r\n\r\nextra_rpaths: []\r\n\r\nto\r\n\r\nextra_rpaths: [/opt/cray/libfabric/1.11.0.4.75/lib64]\r\n\r\nfor the gcc@10.3.0 compiler in .spack/cray/compilers.yaml\r\n\r\nFinally for cairo to install I had to do:\r\n\r\nexport LC_ALL=en_US.utf8\r\n\r\nI'm not sure how to fix these for a user in general, but I am documenting them here.",
