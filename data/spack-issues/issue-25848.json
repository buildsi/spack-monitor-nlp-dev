    "body": "This is a refactoring exercise to clean the code and improve a bit unit-test readability (and also a way to read again parts of the code that I didn't touch in a while). It doesn't modify in any way the current behavior of Spack.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] Export platforms from `spack.platforms` directly, so that client modules don't have to import submodules\r\n- [x] Use only plain imports in `test/architecture.py`\r\n- [x] Parametrized test in `test/architecture.py` and put most of the setup/teardown in fixtures\r\n",
