    "body": "Hi All,\r\n\r\nI have a handful of small PR's pending (#2993, #2995, #2997, #3020 (fresh)) that haven't been merged.\r\n\r\nI also noticed that develop hasn't picked up any commits recently.\r\n\r\nIs it frozen while people work on the 1.0 release?  Or, to the same end, are all hands working on the release?  If so, are there plans for when \"the logjam will burst\" :)?\r\n\r\nThanks (as always)!",
