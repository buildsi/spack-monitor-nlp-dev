    "body": "To better conform with existing use of packages that provide both Blas/Lapack/FFTW functionality rather than use a package to link to another package just provide the functionality in the package and have armpl only provide the free download for GCC.\r\n\r\nSeemed to work but couldn't test all combinations.\r\n\r\nUrl for downloads seemed to change and possible version upgrades for ARM compiler as well but left it to just fix the blas/lapack/fftw provision.  Documentation could be updated to mirror the Intel Parallel Studio where it might be best to use a dummy compiler (`/bin/true`) to install the main arm package and then go back and update the compiler to point to the arm package compilers.  E.g. how its done for Intel https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_systems/intelpackage.html?highlight=intel#install-steps-for-packages-with-compilers-and-libraries",
