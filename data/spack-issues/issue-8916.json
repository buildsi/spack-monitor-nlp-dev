    "body": "As a user I want core compilers for Lmod to be guessed by Spack (if they are not present in `modules.yaml`) so that I don't have to manually set-up things the first time I generate Lmod module files.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe proposal here is to guess which compilers are installed on the system and write automatically:\r\n```yaml\r\nlmod:\r\n   core_compilers:\r\n     - ...\r\n```\r\nif it is not already present. I think doing something like that makes sense as, from the feedback I receive, people are initially confused by the concept of \"core compilers\" and often don't know what they should put in there. The check done to guess core compilers could be something very simple, like checking if the path where registered compilers live match any pattern that Spack considers a \"system\" path.\r\n\r\nIf people think it's a good idea I'll put this into the `Modules improvement` project and start the implementation.\r\n\r\n@svenevs @SteVwonder ",
