    "body": "* add a variant allowing catch2 to be installed\r\nvia CMake, which is useful for generating a .cmake\r\nconfig file for consumption by other projects\r\n\r\nThis allows me to \"just consume\" the .cmake config files generated after:\r\n\r\n `spack install catch2+use_cmake % gcc@7.4.0`\r\n`spack load catch2`\r\n\r\nI'm sure `spack` devs will want to make changes to this draft approach. I'll do what I can or feel free to push to the branch.",
