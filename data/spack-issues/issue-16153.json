    "body": "`jsoncpp %clang@10.0.0:` will fail building on implicit int-float conversion errors.  Fixed upstream in https://github.com/open-source-parsers/jsoncpp/pull/1023, released in 1.9.2 (also added here).\r\n\r\nI suspect one day other compilers may potentially error on that too, but was conservative with the `@when` clause since this is all I've tested.",
