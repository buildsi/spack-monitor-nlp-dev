    "body": "This pull request adds support for the version of Silo that our code team uses.  Since Spack sorts this version to become the new preferred default, I list \"preferred=True\" on version 4.10.2 so that the original default is kept.  Note that the URL specification is necessary because this version of Silo is not kept in a standard location that the others are :(",
