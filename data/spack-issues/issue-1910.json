    "body": "@adamjstewart I renamed a package, then ran `run-flake8`.  It got confused and tried to run `flake8` on the old package name, which no longer existed; hence, it caused an error.  This was fixed by checking in my pending commit with `git`.  Then everything worked smoothly again.\n\nI would not spend effort trying to \"fix\" this issue.  I would add it as a note to the docs on the unit tests.\n",
