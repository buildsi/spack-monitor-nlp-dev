    "body": "Fixes a bug introduced in #16047. When I added new variants to the netcdf-cxx4 package, a `configure_args()` function needed to be created. I created it and added all the new variants, however I neglected to initially create a config_args list to hold the variant strings. This PR adds that variable which fixes the bug. ",
