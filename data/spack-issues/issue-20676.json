    "body": "Rework the version numbers for intel-xed, now that xed has actual\r\nreleases and tags.  Add releases 11.2.0 and 12.0.1.  Rename 2019.03.01\r\nto 10.2019.03 as a legacy version that fits in the new order.\r\n\r\nAdd variant +pic to compile libxed.a with PIC code so that it can be\r\nlinked into another shared library.\r\n\r\nAdd conflict for aarch64.\r\nAdd myself as maintainer.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nAgain, my project (hpctoolkit) is the only other package that\r\nexplicitly depends on intel-xed, so reworking the version numbers is\r\nunlikely to cause trouble.",
