    "body": "The changes in this pull request improve the `Silo` package by adding more supported install versions and by adding a `+silex` variant (which allows the installer to toggle whether the `Silo` package's graphical utility will be installed or not).  There are also a few other minor changes to the `Crypto++` package to make its `url_for_version` function a bit more readable using the same techniques to implement `url_for_version` for `Silo`.\n",
