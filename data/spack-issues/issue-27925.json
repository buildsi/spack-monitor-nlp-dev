    "body": "The intent of this PR is to allow for generalized variables that can be used throughout the `spack.yaml` file.  For example, if I have several externals installed in the same location it would be nice to just use a variable or alias to specify them, especially if the path is long, or I want to be able to switch it later. As I iterated over this concept it dawned on me that YAML already has this exact functionality through anchors and aliases.  \r\n\r\nThis PR creates a dedicated place to define anchors in the `spack.yaml` file.  I imagine allowing a wider variety of schema in this section as time goes on, but for starters I'm just doing an array of strings which can be used to generate a list of variables (anchors really) which can then be used throughout the `spack.yaml`\r\n\r\nA couple of issues:\r\n\r\n1. I'm not sure if these anchors will propogate to includes files.\r\n2. During concretization spack's process overwrites all the aliases and anchors with the anchor values.  This is a broader issue, but I'm interested to see if I can just turn this behavior off for yaml anchors as part of this PR. \r\n\r\npinging @becker33 (initial discussion of this idea on slack) @scheibelp (wisdom reagarding the overwriting issues) @tgamblin (I see your name in the git history next to all the code containing the work `anchor`) ",
