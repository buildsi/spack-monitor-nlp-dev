    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\n\n`spack install findutils %gcc @11.2.0`\r\n\r\nThis version of GCC was installed via Spack.\r\n\r\n`findutils` uses the macro `__nonnull` internally to expand to `__attribute__((__nonnull__(...)))`, which declarers that certain pointer arguments to functions cannot be null. This fails on my system where this attribute is not supported.\r\n\r\n`findutils` checks whether this attribute is supported on the build system, but this check is not working correctly. This bug was reported upstream in January 2021 as <https://savannah.gnu.org/bugs/?func=detailitem&item_id=59972>.\n\n### Information on your system\n\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-778-2ab871dd17\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.5\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-bigsur-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\n\n### Additional information\n\n[spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7847178/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n[spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7847179/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n[config.log](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7847182/config.log)\r\n\r\n\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
