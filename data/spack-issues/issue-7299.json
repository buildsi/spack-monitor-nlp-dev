    "body": "Since we removed verbosity in build tests (#6901) we experience a high number of build errors in Travis, with this error message:\r\n```\r\nNo output has been received in the last 10m0s, this potentially indicates a stalled build or something wrong with the build itself.\r\nCheck the details on how to adjust your build configuration on: https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#Build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received\r\n```\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Travis logs are terser so I am wondering if we should solve this issue by reverting #6901 or by using a [`travis_wait`](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/common-build-problems/#Build-times-out-because-no-output-was-received) on build tests.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\nBuild tests shouldn't timeout.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Actual Result\r\n\r\nBuild tests error frequently because of timeouts, and sometimes they need to be retriggered manually several times before they succeed.",
