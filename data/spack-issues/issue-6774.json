    "body": "Fixes #6690.\r\n\r\nThis is an attempt to get better coverage of the `spack versions` command.\r\n\r\nNot sure how people feel about tests that require internet access. Even with internet access, these tests sometimes get results and sometimes don't, so I was hesitant to require a certain output for any of these packages. This is more of a \"I can run this command and it doesn't crash\" test than a \"spack versions is actually working correctly\" test.",
