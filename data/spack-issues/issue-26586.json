    "body": "Sorry, it seems that I had a typo in #26553 for the version restriction. For `py-matplotlib@3.4.3` the qhull restrictions were contradicting:  'qhull@2020.2:' and 'qhull@2015.2:2020.1 where both true so that concretization failed when pinning it to that specific version. I only tested if `spack install --test=true py-matplolib` still worked and overlooked that it actually concretized to an older version, which ran through.\r\nFixed that now.",
