See here:\r\n\r\n  https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/blob/master/Source/CTest/cmCTestBuildHandler.cxx\r\n\r\n  These are BSD licensed, so the port is in `externa/ctest_log_parser.py`\r\n\r\n- [x] We currently use these to do better filtering of errors from build output.  Plan is to use them to generate good CDash output.\r\n\r\n@aprokop: this doesn't cause a regression on your error message from #5236, does it?\r\n@pramodskumbhar: FYI",
