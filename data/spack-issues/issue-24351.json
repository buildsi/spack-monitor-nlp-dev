    "body": "fixes #24205\r\n\r\nThis commit fixes a subtle bug that may occur when a package is a \"possible_provider\" of a virtual but no \"provides_virtual\" can be deduced. In that case the cardinality constraint on \"provides_virtual\" may arbitrarily assign a package the role of provider even if the constraints for it to be one are not fulfilled. The fix reworks the logic around three concepts:\r\n- \"possible_provider\": a package that may provide a virtual if some constraints are met\r\n- \"provides_virtual\": a package that meet the constraints to provide a virtual\r\n- \"provider\": a package selected to provide a virtual",
