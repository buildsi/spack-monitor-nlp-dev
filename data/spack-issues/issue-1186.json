    "body": "**TLDR** : have a look at the `<name>/package.py` files to have an idea of what this PR does :smile: \n##### Description\n\nThis PR allows sub-classes of `PackageBase` (ex `Package`) to have an arbitrary number of phases.\n\nIt also add a convenient syntax to register arbitrary methods as `preconditions` or `sanity_checks`, meaning that they will be run **before** or **after** the phases they are bound to. \n\nIn the end it should give more flexibility for further development of features like the ones discussed in #169 or #1305 and reduce the boiler-plate code needed in many packages.\n\nA few packages have been converted to exemplify some of the benefits of this refactoring.\n##### Modifications\n- [x] `Package` has been renamed `PackageBase`, it has logic to be extended by subclasses that are tailored to specific build systems\n- [x] decorator syntax to register preconditions and sanity checks to a given phase\n- [x] added `Package` : simple subclass having only an `install` phase (backward-compatible)\n- [x] added `EditableMakefile` : examples in `astyle/package.py`\n- [x] added `AutotoolsPackage` : examples in `gmp/package.py` and others\n- [x] added `CMakePackage` : examples in `openjpeg/package.py` and others\n- [x] `log_output` has been turned into a \"double\" context manager : the external context spawns a daemon that wait for things to write to a file, the internal plug `stderr` and `stdout` to that file\n- [x] all the changes that have been extracted in #1228 \n- [ ] unit tests for the new feature\n- [x] brief documentation of the new subclasses\n",
