    "body": "Simple commands such as `spack compilers` and `spack spec` fail when Spack is installed within a non-Cray container and the container is run on a Cray host. I demonstrate this with Charliecloud below, but I suspect it applies to other container runtimes as well.

This may work on a Cray as well.\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ cd /usr/local/src/charliecloud\r\n$ make\r\n$ export PATH=/usr/local/src/charliecloud/bin:$PATH\r\n$ ch-build -t spack -f examples/other/spack/Dockerfile\r\n$ ch-docker2tar spack /tmp\r\n162M /tmp/spack.tar.gz\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can provide `spack.tar.gz` out of band if needed.\r\n\r\nCopy `spack.tar.gz` to your local Cray, say to `/scratch`.\r\n\r\nBuild Charliecloud on the Cray as well and add its `bin` directory to your `$PATH`.\r\n\r\nOn the Cray:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ ch-tar2dir /scratch/spack/tar.gz /var/tmp\r\n$ ch-run /var/tmp/spack -- /spack/bin/spack compilers\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* Image build host is Debian Stretch.\r\n* Image is Debian Stretch too.\r\n* Cray version:\r\n```\r\n$ cat /etc/opt/cray/release/cle-release\r\nRELEASE=6.0.UP05\r\nBUILD=6.0.5116\r\nDATE=201709151057\r\nARCH=x86_64\r\nNETWORK=ari\r\n``` \r\n* Charliecloud version 0.9.0~pre+69f99a1, but this probably does not matter.\r\n* [Dockerfile and test script](https://github.com/hpc/charliecloud/tree/69f99a144b6960fc6d54f8e7e90b182e89847c5b/examples/other/spack)",
