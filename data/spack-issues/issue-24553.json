    "body": "This PR includes the following updates:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add missing `+objc` module variant\r\n- [x] Enforce `+apps` adding variants for necessary modules (note 1)\r\n- [x] Add several 3rd party component variants (note 2)\r\n- [x] Add missing dependencies for 3rd party components\r\n- [x] Add conflicts for 3rd party components\r\n\r\nNote 1: The `+apps` variant builds several applications. It doesn't seem possible to control _which_ apps get built, but certain apps require certain modules to be enabled. I've added conflicts so that if a user requests `+apps`, we make sure that all applications get built and installed. Fixes #24551 \r\n\r\nNote 2: Previously, I added all 3rd party components that showed up in my `CMakeCache.txt` on macOS. However, OpenCV has many variants which aren't visible on macOS. I've now added a variant for every possible 3rd party component, and OS-specific conflicts where needed.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully builds and passes all tests on macOS 10.15.7 with Apple Clang 12.0.0 using the default variants (everything disabled).\r\n\r\n@bvanessen @gmfricke",
