Compared to that PR, this PR has the disadvantage that reindex will mistakenly add partially-installed packages.\r\n\r\nDuring install, remove prior unfinished installs\r\n\r\nIf a user performs an installation which fails, in some cases the\r\ninstall prefix is still present, and the stage path may also be\r\npresent. With this commit, unless the user specifies\r\n'--keep-prefix', installs are guaranteed to begin with a clean\r\nslate. The database is used to decide whether an install finished,\r\nsince a database record is not added until the end of the install\r\nprocess.",
