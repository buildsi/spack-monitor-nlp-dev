Given that some languages could be using fancy unicode characters like smiley faces (or diacritics) as part of their output, the logger seems like it should be able to ignore them without making a package build fail.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n\r\n",
