    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\n\nI put  `\"type\": \"module\"` in my package.json, and tried to use spack but it gives the first error message.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIf I specify the `--config` option with spack it gives the second error message.\n\n### Error message\n\n1st error:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack.config.js is treated as an ES module file as it is a .js file whose nearest parent package.json contains \"type\": \"module\" which declares all .js files in that package scope as ES modules.\r\nInstead rename spack.config.js to end in .cjs, \r\nchange the requiring code to use dynamic import() which is available in all CommonJS modules, \r\nor change \"type\": \"module\" to \"type\": \"commonjs\" in\r\n /mnt/data/projects/elemental-loader/pkg/package.json to treat all .js files as CommonJS (using .mjs for all ES modules instead).\r\n```\r\n\r\n2nd error:\r\n```\r\n/mnt/data/projects/elemental-loader/pkg/node_modules/.pnpm/@swc+core@1.2.133/node_modules/@swc/core/spack.js:55\r\n                throw new Error(`Error occurred while loading config file at ${config}: ${e}`);\r\n                      ^\r\n\r\nError: Error occurred while loading config file at spack.config.cjs: Error: Cannot find module 'spack.config.cjs'\r\nRequire stack:\r\n- /mnt/data/projects/elemental-loader/pkg/node_modules/.pnpm/@swc+core@1.2.133/node_modules/@swc/core/spack.js\r\n```\n\n### Information on your system\n\nCan't do this as it needs a config file thats valid by spack.\r\n\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
