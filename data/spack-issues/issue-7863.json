    "body": "These are additions and updates to general Spack packages, gleaned from my work over the past year.  They should make a decent addition to Spack overall; and are also needed for my work.\r\n\r\nRather than submitting a hundred mini PR's, I'm submitting one single PR; which we can modify until everything is right.  Hopefully not too long.\r\n",
