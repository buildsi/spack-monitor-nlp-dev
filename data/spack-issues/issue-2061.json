    "body": "I'm having a bit of trouble linking to the Armadillo libraries. When I try compiling something with Armadillo, I'm seeing the following error message:\n\n```\n$ g++  -I/soft/spack-0.9.1/opt/spack/linux-centos6-x86_64/gcc-6.1.0/armadillo-7.500.0-inxgdirrm2cqscwwgqagoztainepayo7/include transport_linear_chain.cpp   -o transport_linear_chain\nIn file included from /soft/spack-0.9.1/opt/spack/linux-centos6-x86_64/gcc-6.1.0/armadillo-7.500.0-inxgdirrm2cqscwwgqagoztainepayo7/include/armadillo:83,\n                 from transport_linear_chain.cpp:11:\n/soft/spack-0.9.1/opt/spack/linux-centos6-x86_64/gcc-6.1.0/armadillo-7.500.0-inxgdirrm2cqscwwgqagoztainepayo7/include/armadillo_bits/include_superlu.hpp:91:53: error: /blues/gpfs/home/software/spack-0.9.1/opt/spack/1-centos6-x86_64/gcc-6.1.0/superlu-5.2.1-7y4mnsbozswcsktwfvvdreocwobyroy4/include/supermatrix.h: No such file or directory\n```\n\nThe main thing to note here is that Armadillo thinks `supermatrix.h` is in `opt/spack/1-centos6-x86_64` when it is really in `opt/spack/linux-centos6-x86_64`. Has anyone ever seen something like this before? I contacted a developer, so hopefully they'll have an answer for me. But I assume it's not an RPATH problem on our end.\n",
