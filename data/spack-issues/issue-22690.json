    "body": "This is the first half of our goal of maintaining a (hopefully short!) list of specs that are known to be broken in develop. Having such a list will allow us to \"fail early\" in CI and not waste resources trying to build packages that are doomed to fail. A follow-up PR will add the functionality to add/remove packages from the broken list.",
