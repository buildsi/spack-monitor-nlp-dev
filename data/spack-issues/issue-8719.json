    "body": "The install phase of the papi package never ends.\r\nThe issue appears only when the spack function filter_file is call in papi/package.py:\r\n- when the call is disabled, the installation succeeds (at least with gcc 6.2.0, but not currently with gcc 8.1.0);\r\n- when when the call is enabled, a UnicodeDecodeError exception seems to be silently raised internally without terminating the program nor reporting any visible error (the full error is: 'utf-8' codec can't decode byte 0xae in position 3433: invalid start byte).",
