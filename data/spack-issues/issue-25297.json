    "body": "### Summary\n\nUQTk provides a Python interface called PyUQTk that is not currently built. This feature request is to add a variant to build PyUQTk and add it to `PYTHONPATH`.\n\n### Rationale\n\nPyUQTk is a very useful, integral part to UQTk.\n\n### Description\n\nAn alternative is to always build PyUQTk, but this would add overhead for those that will not use the PyUQTk interface.\n\n### Additional information\n\n```console\r\n> spack --version\r\n0.16.2-3824-c27e0223d5\r\n```\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
