    "body": "PETSc has its [own build system](https://petsc.org/main/install/), but it fits a `./configure`, `make`, `make install` pattern.\r\n\r\nCurrently all the logic for a PETSc install is included in the `install()` method of the package. If another package inherits from this all of the logic must be reproduced.\r\n\r\nThis PR splits the PETSc installation into minimal `configure()`, `build()` and `install()` methods.\r\n\r\nAll the logic determining the correct arguments for the configure step is moved to the `configure_options()` so it can be reproduced easily in a subclass.\r\n\r\nI don't fully understand why the package reverts changes by kokkos-nvcc-wrapper, and I'm not sufficiently familiar with the interplay between PETSc, Kokkos and Cuda. The method `revert_kokkos_nvcc_wrapper()` just reproduces the behaviour of the original package in the configure, build and install stages.",
