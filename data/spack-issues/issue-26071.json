    "body": "depends on #26119\r\nfixes #26189\r\n\r\nCurrently Spack uses the built-in configuration scopes for bootstrapping (i.e. \"defaults\", \"system\", \"site\" and \"user\"). This PR makes it such that bootstrapping instead uses its own \"bootstrap\" configuration scope on top of \"defaults\", so that changes done during bootstrapping are not interacting with user configuration and vice-versa.\r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n- [x] Point bootstrapping configuration to a `config` folder inside the bootstrapping root\r\n- [x] Search for external build tools automatically when bootstrapping from sources\r\n- [x] Account for configuration in `config.yaml` during the bootstrap phase\r\n- [x] Don't include removing the bootstrap area with `spack clean -a`\r\n- [x] Add unit tests and update documentation",
