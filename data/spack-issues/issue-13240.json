    "body": "(Follow on to feedback on #12733.)\r\n\r\nAlthough I read your point at https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/12733#discussion_r327760429, my general preference is still to avoid monkeypatching system functions whenever possible. For example could `stage.create_stage_root` take an extra parameter that is an object which can determine the accessibility of file paths? In that case `test_create_stage_root` could pass in a mocked version of that object.\r\n\r\n_Originally posted by @scheibelp in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/12733/files_",
