    "body": "Every virtual package in Spack should have a default provider explicitly set in `etc/spack/defaults/packages.yaml`. This prevents changes in the concretizer from determining which virtual dependency is chosen by default. Of course, it doesn't prevent changes in the explicitly set defaults, but it should at least prevent unwanted surprises.",
