    "body": "It's not clear why this flag wasn't previously always on: perhaps a tribits logic error in the amesos2 package? Since it's formatted like an automatic variable that TriBITS would inject if LAPACK were a tribits dependency (which it's not).\r\n\r\nCompiled and installed, verifying the Amesos2 lapack wrappers were available with:\r\n```\r\nspack install trilinos+amesos2~mpi~amesos~anasazi~aztec~epetra~epetraext\r\n```",
