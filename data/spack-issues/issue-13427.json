    "body": "I first encountered this problem when dealing with the `node-js`-induced `python@2` restriction of `py-jupyter-notebook` (part of the discussion of #10319) and fixed in #13020. The tar-balls under github.com/<project>/archive (github's \"Releases\" tab) do not necessarily correspond to the tar-balls released via pypi.\r\nIn the particular case of `py-jupyter-notebook` there is a significant difference between the \"source\"-distribution from github and the \"prebuild\"-distribution from pypi. In particular in the former case the installation has to do the mimifying of the JS and CSS code, for pypi this is already done. In a less dramatic fashion, I noticed that at least for a number of jupyter packages they don't have a version identifier in their github \"releases\". These seem to only be added in their publishing script.\r\n\r\nLong story short: I think it would be a good idea to strongly discourage non-pypi fetch-url's for python packages and maybe even do a concerted effort to move the existing github-based ones to pypi.",
