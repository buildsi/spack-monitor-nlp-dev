    "body": "This package makes use of some standard BLAS and LAPACK functions but I was unable to get it working using the `blas` and `lapack` virtual dependencies. This recipe uses `openblas` to resolve all the needed functions but if the virtual dependencies are preferable then I can try more to get them working.\r\n\r\nThe two major problems I ran into were `atlas` build problems and it seemed that `lapack` did not actually bring any packages into the spec.",
