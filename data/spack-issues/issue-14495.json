    "body": "@chuckatkins @danlipsa \r\n\r\nThis may be a feature request. This is not an error when builing ParaView, but when building other software that links against the spack-built paraview@5.7.0, there are a lot of errors like:\r\n```\r\nlib/libvtkPythonInterpreter-pv5.7.so.5.7: undefined reference to 'PyImport_AddModule'\r\n```\r\n\r\nAdding the following cmake option to ParaView's package.py and turning it off seems to fix the issue:\r\n```\r\n-DVTK_PYTHON_OPTIONAL_LINK:BOOL=OFF\r\n```\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install paraview@5.7.0 ~opengl2+python3+osmesa+plugins\r\n$ # Build a code that links against that paraview\r\n```",
