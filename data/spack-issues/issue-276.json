    "body": "@alalazo: see if this fixes #235.\n- Move `find_versions_of_archive` from spack.package to `spack.util.web`.\n- `spider` funciton now just uses the link parsing it already does to\n  return links.  We evaluate actual links found in the scraped pages\n  instead of trying to reconstruct them naively.\n- Add `spack url-parse` command, which you can use to show how Spack\n  interprets the name and version in a URL.\n",
