    "body": "This pull request will add support for analyze with recursive, a new flag that will not only analyze a spec directly named, but also all its direct dependencies. We will want to do this if we ever run libabigail (or other analyzers) to generate output for an entire tree. Since this depends on https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/26807 and I'm impatient, I added those changes here too, and can update either depending on which is reviewed and merged first.",
