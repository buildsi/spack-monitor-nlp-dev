    "body": "This is a response to goal **3.A** described in @becker33's discussion at #20536:\r\n\r\n> **3.A Mirror VCS software separately**\r\n>\r\n> This PR will establish the mirror subdirectories for each VCS system, and manage when we pull/fail for unfound git refs for each type of mirror. It will leave for future work the details for non-git VCS systems, while reserving their subdirectory names for that future use.\r\n\r\n### Changes\r\n1. Introduce `GitRef` class to isolate logic per type of reference (commit, tag, branch).\r\n1. Introduce `GitRepo` class to isolate logic per git repo or worktree.\r\n1. Refactor `GitFetchStrategy` to create a new git *worktree* in each staging directory, after fetching the appropriate refs in a separate cached repo.\r\n    - Reserve the cache subdirectory names for `svn` and `hg` for future use as in the prompt. This is done implicitly in the new `.persistent_cache_dir_for()` method in `FsCache`, which uses the fetcher's `.url_attr` as the first component of the relative cache path.\r\n1. Implement the update logic described in #20536: tags and commits will never be re-fetched, while branches will be re-fetched if the remote repo is accessible.\r\n1. Make several changes to `package.py` files to fix ambiguous `version()` directives (by adding `branch='master'`), as well as some other changes which have been isolated to the last commit for easier review.",
