    "body": "There are two methods to bootstrap clingo: from official pre-built binaries & by building from sources. They are called: github-actions and spack-install respectively.\r\n\r\nBoth names are questionable: \"github-actions\" is an implementation detail? \"spack-install\" does not imply \"from sources\".\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes the names and adds automated config updates.\r\n\r\nEdit: I just realized that maybe I got `spack-install` wrong, but I would hope that that option forces a build from sources instead of checking a binary mirror? Or not @alalazo?\r\n",
