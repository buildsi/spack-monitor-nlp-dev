    "body": "Fixes #5258\r\n\r\nI wasn't aware of this, but it appears that Package subclasses can override the variants of their parents. The llvm Cmake package was using the default Cmake build_type ```RelWithDebInfo``` which was significantly increasing the size of the package. This redefines the ```build_type``` variant for llvm and sets the default value to ```Release```.\r\n\r\nAnother option would be to set the default ```build_type``` to Release for all Cmake packages. I opted to set this specifically for llvm because it seemed particularly important that llvm control its default build type.",
