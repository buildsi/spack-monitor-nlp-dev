    "body": "Attempting to build Kokkos with `x86_64_v2`, `x86_64_v3`, or `x86_64_v4` previously failed since the arches were unknown to the package dictionary. I added them in following the convention that `v2` is equivalent to `nehalem`, `v3` to `haswell` and `v4` to `skylake`. Testing a build under each locally worked for me. Let me know if anyone has questions!\r\n\r\nPinging @tgamblin for his knowledge of micro-architectures and to check my understanding of the equivalencies.",
