    "body": "Happened to notice that Spack's label set includes two labels of similar name, ``help-wanted`` and ``help wanted``. I think GitHub has special sauce for the later form but not the former? In addition, the dash-form is associated with **one** Spack issue where as the non-dash-form is associated with 7, https://github.com/spack/spack/labels?page=2&sort=name-asc. I would adjust myself but am worried it'll cause other unforseen issues. But, if you go to above link, you can delete the dash-form",
