    "body": "Update Bedops to 2.4.40 which includes multiple bug fixes.\r\n\r\n**Summarized Changelog:**\r\n- Modified wig2bed start and end shift arithmetic to ensure conversion from 1-based, fully-closed indexing to 0-based, half-open indexing.\r\n- Added wig2bed integration tests. See tests/conversion/Makefile and wig2bed_* targets for more detail.\r\n- Sample input updated for gtf2bed and gff2bed online documentation.\r\n- Conversion of GTF to BED would fail with an error where one of either the gene_id or transcript_id attribute is missing, such as in Ensembl-sourced GTF. This behavior has been changed to a warning.\r\n\r\nFull changelog can be found [here](https://bedops.readthedocs.io/en/latest/content/revision-history.html#v2-4-40).\r\n\r\n**Test Plan:**\r\nBedops v2.4.40 built successfully in the Autamus Workflow [here](https://github.com/autamus/registry/runs/3134767644).",
