    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack solve zlib\r\n[ ... ]\r\n$ ls $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/modules/\r\nlinux-rhel5-x86_64  linux-ubuntu20.04-icelake\r\n```\r\nSimilarly for `lmod` if it is enabled in `modules.yaml`\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\nNo errors, but since module files are not needed during bootstrapping they should be disabled. This issue has been firstly reported on Slack by @mwkrentel  (in his case an incomplete configuration of `lmod` was causing failures in the bootstrapping procedure).\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nNot relevant for the bug, but:\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-4165-c424b86a64\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.10\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-icelake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
