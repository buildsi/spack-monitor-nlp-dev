    "body": "fixes #9857 \r\n\r\nThis PR improves the validation of `modules.yaml` by introducing a custom validator that checks if an attribute listed in `properties` or `patternProperties` is a valid spec. This new check applied to the test case in #9857 gives:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install szip\r\n==> Error: /home/mculpo/.spack/linux/modules.yaml:5: \"^python@2.7@\" is an invalid spec [Invalid version specifier]\r\n```\r\n\r\n@tgamblin @adamjstewart @scheibelp and others: can you please double check the schema? `modules.yaml` is fairly complex to check and more eyes could spot more bugs.\r\n\r\n@trecakov Can you try this PR on the failure you reported in Slack? Hopefully you'll get an error report pointing to the exact line that needs to be changed.",
