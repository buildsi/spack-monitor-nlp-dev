    "body": "Usually people don't post the actual package spec when reporting build errors. The spec often includes critical clues to debugging: such as whether a dependency was an external, what system and compiler are being used, what variants have been selected due to environment and user preferences.\r\n\r\nThis adds default values for users to fill in for the output, since currently those are displayed as \"placeholders\" rather than \"values\". (This may be a recent change on github's part due to the issue template feature being in beta.):\r\n<img width=\"851\" alt=\"Screen Shot 2022-02-05 at 16 55 09\" src=\"https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/741229/152660406-9ad86c15-6c83-4d87-981e-fc6a997217b7.png\">\r\n\r\nI don't think I can test this on the issue template on this branch, unless one of the higher-level admins can help?",
