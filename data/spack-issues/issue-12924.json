    "body": "*Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the\r\nreport please:*\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2. Provide the information required below.\r\n3. Remove the template instructions before posting the issue.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install doxygen \r\n```\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe doxygen package ([package.py](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/master/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/doxygen/package.py)) seems to load the source code from http://ftp.stack.nl/pub/users/dimitri/doxygen-1.8.10.src.tar.gz respectively http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/ which are both offline.\r\n\r\nI'd suggest to use the tarball from the official site:\r\nhttp://doxygen.nl/files/doxygen-1.8.16.src.tar.gz for the latest release and https://sourceforge.net/projects/doxygen/files/ is the official way to get older releases.",
