    "body": "Fixes #3476.\r\n\r\nSpack install would previously fail if it could not load a package for the thing being uninstalled.\r\n\r\nThis reworks uninstall to handle cases where the package is no longer known, e.g.:\r\n  - the package has been renamed or is no longer in Spack\r\n  - the repository the package came from is no longer registered in\r\n       repos.yaml\r\n\r\nTODO: the handling of pre- and post-install hooks is still awkward, as they require package instances.  They should really take specs.  That is TBD in a future PR.",
