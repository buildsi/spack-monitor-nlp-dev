    "body": "Adds a package for the kitty terminal.\r\n\r\nA few of the dependencies needed `setup_dependent_environment` implemented in order to be detected/used. For example, the `util-macros` package provides several m4 macros, which aren't discovered unless `ACLOCAL_PATH` is properly set.\r\n\r\nOne of kitty's dependencies, `libxkbcommon`, needed a few dependencies of its own added in order to compile.",
