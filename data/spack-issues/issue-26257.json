    "body": "The [ActsConfig.cmake](https://github.com/acts-project/acts/blob/v13.0.0/cmake/ActsConfig.cmake.in#L59) includes a `find_dependency(Eigen3)` line. Requiring depends_on type='build' does not expose eigen to dependents during their build.\r\n\r\nThis has been the case since v0.28.0, https://github.com/acts-project/acts/commit/370e4a98f10837c68750f865f584277283d80fac, but I think even before then there was an eigen dependency, just not included in ActsConfig.cmake (as deduced from the commit message).",
