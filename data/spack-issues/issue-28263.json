Not sure how this would work since you can't load a volume when building an image\r\n- warn user that local repo will be ignored and strip it from the spack.yaml in the dockerfile\r\n\r\nThanks!\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n```\r\n => ERROR [builder 4/6] RUN cd /opt/spack-environment &&     spack env activate . &&     spack install --fail-fast &&     spack gc -y                                                                                                         1.3s\r\n------\r\n > [builder 4/6] RUN cd /opt/spack-environment &&     spack env activate . &&     spack install --fail-fast &&     spack gc -y:\r\n#10 1.197 ==> Warning: Failed to initialize repository: './spack-repo'.\r\n#10 1.197   No repo.yaml found in './spack-repo'\r\n#10 1.197   To remove the bad repository, run this command:\r\n#10 1.197       spack repo rm ./spack-repo\r\n#10 1.197 ==> Error: Package 'zofu' not found.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.10\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
