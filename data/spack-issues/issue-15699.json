    "body": "* pfunit `3.2.9` can now be built with XL compiler\r\ntoolchain; fixes are limited to this version because\r\nthe required changes were complex and time consuming\r\nto test\r\n\r\n* the changes include adding support for `xl_r` spec,\r\nFortran module path handling tailored to XLF, and a moderately-sized\r\npatch to avoid an apparent issue XLF has with deferred\r\nprocedure handling in inheritance chains\r\n\r\ncc: @AndrewGaspar @cferenba @gshipman @junghans \r\n\r\nProbably needs careful review. Haven't tried executing tests with it yet, but build succeeds with spack in my hands.",
