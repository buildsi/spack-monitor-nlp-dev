    "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nI am managing the applications on a HPC cluster and currently I am testing spack to figure out if it would make sense for us to use it for building software on the cluster.\r\n\r\nI appreciate the possibility to have the modules files created as part of a spack package. For the application life-cycle management on our cluster, we use 3 module categories \"new\", \"supported\" and \"legacy\" to indicate if a version of a particular software is not yet fully supported, fully supported or obsolete.\r\n\r\nWould it be possible to specify multiple locations, where spack can generate the module file for a software (maybe depending on a flag) ? Or would it be possible to generate all module files in the same directory and then modify the spark package such that the module file is moved to the proper module directory for a particular version of a software ?\r\n\r\nBest regards\r\n\r\nSam\r\n",
