    "body": "I am trying to create a spack package.py for my application that depends on a specific version of gcc.  When it goes to configure, it uses the system install of gcc and not the spack depends_on compiler.  I'm working off of devel spack.  \r\n\r\n```\r\nfrom spack import *\r\nclass Foo(CMakePackage):\r\ndepends_on('gcc@6.4.0')\r\n```\r\n\r\n## other notes\r\nThe gcc@6.4.0 I am using was built with at system gcc 8.3.0.  The gcc@6.4.0 is in my compilers.yaml file.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
