    "body": "<!--*Please add a concise summary of your suggestion here.*-->\r\nAn option that gives spack the flexibility to try and re-fetch an application or dependency if failed.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\n<!--*Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe it!*-->\r\nI am trying to use spack in a building a docker image with specific applications to be installed, and these applications are big and it takes a lot of time to build, and sometimes when spack try to install a dependency, it fails in fetching the source file due to a network glitch or something else, and then it continues for the next dependency and when it reaches the installation of the application it fails, this consumes a lot of time as I am forced to rebuild the docker image after every failure.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\n<!--*Describe the solution you'd like and the alternatives you have considered.*-->\r\nI don't know if this is feature already exists or no, but I'd like that spack try to refetch the application source file every time it fails to fetch from all urls, as sometimes there is a network glitch or instability in the network connection. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
