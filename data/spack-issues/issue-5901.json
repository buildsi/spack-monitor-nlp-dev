    "body": "Scalpel's a bit of a mess, it expects it's users to just unpack the\r\ntarball, build it in the resulting directory and install that\r\ndirectory onto their PATH.  My install step recapitulates this into\r\nprefix.bin.  The alternative was rewiring their scripts (perl), which\r\nuse `FindBin` and expect things to be located in the same dir that the\r\nscript itself is.\r\n\r\nSigh.\r\n\r\nLightly tested on CentOS 7.",
