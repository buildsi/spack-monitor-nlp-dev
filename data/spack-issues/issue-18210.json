    "body": "This PR fixes existing smoke tests relying on  test data to use the new `test_data_dir` property and regular expression comparisons for output that needs escaped characters.\r\n\r\nIt also makes the layout of test part purposes consistent; uses `join_path` instead of `os.path.join`; and eliminates `xmllint`'s version test since the version `.` replacement isn't as simple as originally thought.",
