    "body": "### Problem\r\n\r\nFixes #20123, subsumes #20218.\r\n\r\n**Note:** this PR does **not** attempt to address the problem of actually making spack build clingo on demand in such environments. We will rely on #20207 for that.\r\n\r\n### Solution\r\n- Require `clingo+python` to depend on `python+shared` (this was already necessary, but was working because the `python` package defaults to `+shared`).\r\n  - #20116 fixes this.\r\n- Pull in the changes from #20139 and #20218.\r\n- Add support for building clingo on python 2.6.\r\n- **TODO** Add a test for installation in the centos6 test shard.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\n1. A bootstrap mechanism is created for `clingo` to bootstrap itself in python 2.6-only environments.\r\n2. Spack is able to avoid sneakily modifying the user's running python version (so no python code breaks because spack installed its own interpreter).\r\n3. This is tested in CI!",
