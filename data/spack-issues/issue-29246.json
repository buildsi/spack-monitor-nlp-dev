    "body": "This PR fixes a problem building netcdf-cxx4 (all the way up to the latest public release 4.3.1) on macOS with its semi case-sensitive file systems. An additional bug fix is required to get the correct library dependency on netcdf-c into the netcdf-cxx4 build on macOS, which uses `libtool`.\r\n\r\nThe PR also aligns the netcdf-cxx4 package config with the (better maintained) netcdf-fortran package config.\r\n\r\nFixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/29245\r\nFixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/26559\r\n\r\nThis PR was tested on macOS Monterey with llvm-clang@13.0.0 (and gfortran@11.2.0), as well as on a Cray (NOAA-GFDL Gaea) with intel@2021.3.0.",
