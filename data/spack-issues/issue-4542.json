    "body": "I've been hesitant to set up a chat channel for Spack simply because I worried that we wouldn't know how to deal with all the traffic.  After seeing a few other projects use Slack successfully, I'm a bit less worried, and I think this will be useful for folks who want to work together on new features or coordinate across sites on all things Spack-related.  I think it's also another way to get to know folks who are using Spack.  Also, I piped GitHub notifications over there.\r\n\r\nSo now there is Spack on Slack. (Splack!?)\r\n\r\nI deployed a little [Heroku app](https://spackpm.herokuapp.com) (based on [rauchg/slackin](https://github.com/rauchg/slackin)) so that people can sign up automatically.  Hopefully this will be pretty easy for people to join.\r\n\r\nI also added a badge to `README.md` that shows how many people are online.  Currently, if you click the badge, you're taken to the signup page, which has a link to sign in if you're already registered.  We could also point it directly to Slack, but then new people would have to scroll down to see how to sign up.  I suspect that most people will just keep Slack running after they sign up (since that is what I do) so I optimized for people who still need to sign up.  Thoughts?\r\n\r\n@alalazo @adamjstewart\r\n\r\n- [x] Set up a Slack channel for Spack at [spackpm.slack.com](https://spackpm.slack.com)\r\n- [x] Added a badge to show who's online.\r\n- [x] Added a section to `README.md` under \"Get involved!\"",
