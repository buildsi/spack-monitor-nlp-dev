    "body": "`spack find --format` always prints the roots and environment header when in an environment, making it difficult to consume in scripts.\r\n\r\nI propose that this should not be the case and that it should only print the formatted installed packages.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nIn an environment, run this:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack find --format '{arch}/{compiler.name}-{compiler.version}/{name}-{version}-{hash}'\r\n==> In environment /Users/aat/Development/cash-packages\r\n==> Root specs\r\n...\r\ndarwin-catalina-x86_64/clang-11.0.0-apple/awscli-1.16.308-2tqend6rcdliqwovemjypkbeljjexdsb\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\nNote that the environment and root specs blocks are printed, making the output of `--format` quite difficult to parse.\r\n",
