    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack spec slurm | grep glib\r\n    ^glib@2.53.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nbut this version of glib is marked as `deprecated`.\r\n\r\nI can nudge clingo into taking a newer version of glib:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack spec slurm ^glib@2.60: | grep glib\r\n    ^glib@2.66.7\r\n```\r\nand it concretizes fine to the latest glib.\r\n\r\nThe problem is that `glib@2.66.7` depends on `meson` whereas `glib@2.53` does not, and this ultimately pulls in a virtual dependency on `uuid` only for the former.\r\n\r\nApparently clingo prefers fewer virtual dependencies over newer versions, so it ends up preferring `glib@2.53` even though it is deprecated.\r\n\r\nWhen setting `variant('uuid',     default=False,  description='Build uuid module')` by default in Python, `spack spec slurm` concretizes to using `glibc@2.66.7` indeed.\r\n\r\nSo I think there's 2 issues:\r\n\r\n- Clingo should try to prefer new versions over fewer virtual deps\r\n- Clingo should avoid concretizing to deprecated packages when there is an alternative\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-1812-8d2944bf77\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.7\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n",
