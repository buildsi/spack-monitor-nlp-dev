    "body": "`libxc` failed to compile on my somewhat older login nodes whose CPUs do not have AVX.\r\n\r\nThis patch lowers the minimum required CPU feature to `SSE4.2` ([introduced in 2008-11](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SSE4#SSE4.2)) but also targets AVX and AVX2 where available at runtime.\r\n\r\nCaveat: I applied the same opt flags to `libint`, which, alas, still had `SSE2` as baseline. Both packages are prerequisites for `cp2k`.\r\n\r\n**TBD:** This is bound to be of interest for other high-throughput HPC packages. Rather than each coming up with its own concept for how to target a CPU feature, or a range thereof, is there some sort of _Spack idiom_? Perhaps something like `compilers.yaml`, but still possibly _per-package-optional_?\r\n",
