Instead of statically linking, we could also figure out how to correctly link to Spack's `zlib` installation. We could also consider replacing `minizip` with this fork: https://github.com/nmoinvaz/minizip. Homebrew has a `minizip2` package that uses this, but there seems to be a compatibility layer between them. Currently, `libkml` is the only package that depends on `minizip`, so we have some flexibility on this.",
