    "body": "I found I need to create both a `[blas]` and `[lapack]` section in `site.cfg` for `py-numpy` when using `netlib-lapack`. Numpy has no problem proceeding when it doesn't find blas or lapack, but Scipy fails when I'm using `netlib-lapack` because it currently can't find the blas and lapack libraries from `py-numpy`. This resolves such a situation. I also changed the definition of `lapackblas` because currently it gives `,lapack,blas` when writing to `site.cfg` and using `lapackblas=[]` fixes the preceding comma.",
