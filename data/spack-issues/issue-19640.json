    "body": "Fixes #19629.\r\n\r\nAlso changes how padding is specified.\r\n\r\nSince #11598 sbang has been installed in the install_tree. This doesn't play nicely with install_tree padding, since sbang can't do its job if it's installed in a long path.\r\n\r\nThis PR changes the padding specification so padding can only be at the end of the string, and stores the install_tree root both with and without padding. The root without padding is stored as `spack.store.store.short_root`.\r\n\r\nNow, sbang is installed to `spack.store.store.short_root`/bin. This path should remain short enough for sbang to work.",
