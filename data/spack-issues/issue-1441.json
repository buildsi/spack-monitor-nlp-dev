    "body": "Currently, installing MPICH fails with a `KeyError` if no Fortran compiler is available. This patch fixes it.\n\nI am actually not sure whether it really makes a lot of sense to support this configuration, though. Many packages fail if no Fortran compiler or Fortran MPI wrapper is found (for example, PAPI).\n",
