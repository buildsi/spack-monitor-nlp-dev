    "body": "Inspired by #14657, I decided to automatically add the flags needed by the NAG Fortran compiler to build most packages. This is the same advice we give in https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html#nag and what I used at ANL back in the day. Pinging @ThemosTsikas in case he has any thoughts about always adding these flags. I believe @skosukhin @willfurnass also use NAG with Spack.",
