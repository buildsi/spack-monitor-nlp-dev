The problem is that previously, `sundials+hypre` didn't depend on `hypre`, `sundials+hypre+int64` and `sundials+hypre~int64` depended on `hypre`. Spack's concretizer isn't currently smart enough to realize that this represents the entire space of possibilities, and tries to decide whether or not the package actually depends on `hypre` before it makes a final decision as to the value of `+int64`. By specifying that `sundials+hypre` _always_ depends on `hypre`, we can get around this problem.",
