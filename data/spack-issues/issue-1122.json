    "body": "Fixes #1075.\n- [X] renamed `spack.architecture.sys_type()` to `spack.architecture.platform()`\n- [X] added a `spack.architecture.sys_type()` that reports the default platform-os-target string for this machine.\n- [X] `spack arch` now prints the full arch string for the default platform-os-target\n\nTBD later:\n- Add better programmatic ways to get the available front-end and back-end os-target combinations.\n- Figure out a decent policy for modules (module path should probably include all the backends, at least).\n",
