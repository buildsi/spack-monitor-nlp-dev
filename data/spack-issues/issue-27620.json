    "body": "It is a followup of https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/26028, and I can add that it affects also an older version of umpire (e.g. `umpire@4.1.2`).\r\n\r\nApparently the previous conflict was not working correctly.\r\n\r\nJust to be clear, there not seems to be any gcc@10.4.0 version, it is used just as a (reasonable?) upper bound, based on the hope that the GCC bug reported here\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/pull/25980 is actually the problem with umpire (unfortunately I did not have the chance to test it) and it is already fixed in newer versions (i.e. >=11).",
