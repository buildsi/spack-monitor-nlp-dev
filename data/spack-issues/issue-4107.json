Note that the problem is there even though there is `^openblas`.\r\n\r\np.s. this is without any `packages.yaml` file, only `compilers.yaml`\r\n\r\n---\r\n\r\n**TLDR**: currently a workaround is to specify both `mpi` and `lapack` providers, that is do\r\n```\r\nspack install dealii@develop%gcc@5.4.0+mpi ^openmpi ^openblas\r\n```\r\n---\r\nMWE of the problem to be added to the unit tests is https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/4107#issuecomment-298889480\r\n",
