    "body": "Getting several import and other runtime errors from `py-deeptools@3.2.1` executables due to missing dependencies lagging behind upstream:\r\nhttps://github.com/deeptools/deepTools/blob/master/requirements.txt\r\n\r\nTo run unit tests via spack, I patch in upstream's nose test suite so that we can now run:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nspack install --test root --verbose py-deeptools ^python@3:\r\n```\r\n\r\n1.  The trade off for running unit tests is switching the URL from the small pypi tarball [188K] to the larger GitHub release tarball [60M] which includes the test data files.  But I expect it will save us maintainers multiple hours of packaging and troubleshooting.\r\n2. Of the 108 tests, only 5 fail, all of which are related to the heatmapper plotting functions.  Those failures look harmless to me; they are image size differences and RMS tolerance differences.  Reported upstream in deeptools/deepTools#863",
