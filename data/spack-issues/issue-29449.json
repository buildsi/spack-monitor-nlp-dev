    "body": "Currently OpenMPI 4+ requires PMIx and provides a vendored copy (version 3.2.3 for OpenMPI 4.1.2) if not found. This change uses Spack's PMIx to provide a dependency and updates the available PMIx versions, as well as removing an artificial constraint on the libevent used by pmix. Finally, since the `pmix` variant is only useful for OpenMPI 2 and 3, I added a `when` clause for it.\r\n\r\n(The reason I'm concerned about pmix is our CI server has been seeing hangs in simple single-process global barriers, and occasional crashes coming from pmix error checking code. I'm hoping that a newer version of PMIx might fix these.)",
