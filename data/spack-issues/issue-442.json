    "body": "The changes in the pull request add the following meshing packages to Spack's built-in package list:\n- **[Crypto++](http://cryptopp.com/)**: A C++ library that implements a number of functions that are useful for cryptography.\n- **[Exodus II](https://github.com/gsjaardema/seacas)**: A C++ library developed by Sandia to help with the storing and loading of meshes used for finite element analysis.\n- **[ndiff](http://ftp.math.utah.edu/pub/ndiff/)**: A diff-like tool that can be used to diff files that may have slight numerical differences.\n- **[TetGen](http://wias-berlin.de/software/tetgen/)**: A C++ library that can generate tetrahedra for any closed solid given a triangulated set of that solid's boundary surfaces.\n- **[Triangle](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~quake/triangle.html)**: A C/C++ library that generates triangulated surfaces for any given closed and planar boundary.\n\nThis version of the pull request includes the changes mentioned by @tgamblin in #441. Please let me know if there are any other problems with these package implementations!\n",
