[The process will take several minutes] [Y/n] \r\n==> Warning: Missing a source id for python@2.7.5\r\n==> Installing libiconv-1.16-zczi37byglq3f5vweadydldeqadhr52u\r\n==> Warning: Spack will not check SSL certificates. You need to update your Python to enable certificate verification.\r\n==> No binary for libiconv-1.16-zczi37byglq3f5vweadydldeqadhr52u found: installing from source\r\n==> Using cached archive: /m100/home/userexternal/mculpo02/github/spack/var/spack/cache/_source-cache/archive/e6/e6a1b1b589654277ee790cce3734f07876ac4ccfaecbee8afa0b649cf529cc04.tar.gz\r\n==> libiconv: Executing phase: 'autoreconf'\r\n==> libiconv: Executing phase: 'configure'\r\n[ ... ]\r\n```\r\nAt the moment the process is interactive, to avoid starting a ~15 mins. build without the user being aware of it, but ideally it should be automated (if made fast enough) or be interactive only for command line use of Spack. A Spack environment is used to bootstrap the software and install it at a fixed location. \r\n\r\nImprovements that can be made on top of this:\r\n\r\n- [ ] Look for dependencies that are already in the system (e.g. cmake) and use them as \"externals\"\r\n- [ ] Remove interactive confirmation from user, at least for non cli use of Spack\r\n- [ ] Check prerequisites for building `clingo` (e.g. compiler with support for C++14)\r\n\r\nSubmitting as draft to get some early feedback.\r\n\r\n@becker33 @tgamblin @cosmicexplorer ",
