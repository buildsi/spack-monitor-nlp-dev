    "body": "+ Eliminate `install` method (use the one from CMakePackage).\r\n+ Move configure options to new method `cmake_args` and eliminate the `+debug` variant as it might conflict with `build_type=` and is redundant with `build_type=Debug +gdb`.\r\n+ Move special install instructions for DarwinOS to a `run_after` method.\r\n\r\nThis needs to be tested on Darwin OS before being merged.  I am unable to test the `darwin_fix` method.\r\n  ",
