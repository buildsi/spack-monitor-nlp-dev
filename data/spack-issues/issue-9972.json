    "body": "Added support for the SEACAS package from Sandia.  Contains the exodus library (aka exodusII) and several applications which can create, modify, query, translate exodus files.  Also includes IOSS library and the aprepro library and application.   Documentation at http://gsjaardema.github.io/seacas/\r\n\r\nSeveral variants are available, but not all have yet been tested.  I have tested the default allpkgs build with and without mpi and that seems to be working correctly.\r\n\r\nBest current version of SEACAS source code is the `develop` branch on github.  I hope to have better versioning soon...",
