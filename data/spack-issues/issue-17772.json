    "body": "This PR adds [Config File Variables](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html#config-file-variables) to `config.yaml:extensions` paths.\r\n\r\nI'd like to see it cherry-picked for v0.15, if you don't mind, because it looked like a bug the first time I tried to use variables there.\r\n\r\nI did my best to find all the places where the 'extensions' config was used. And factorized it.\r\n\r\nI arbitrarily used `spack.util.path.canonicalize_path` instead of `substitute_path_variables`: not sure which is best.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
