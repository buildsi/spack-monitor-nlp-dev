    "body": "Exawind needs to build against trilinos@develop to sniff out errors before they are merged to master. This restores the `develop` trilinos version branch but simplifies some of the version logic from before it was removed (i.e. `@master,develop` to `@master:`). Also fixes some contradictions in other versioning: `dtk` conflicts with `master` but provided a resource for `@master`.\r\n\r\ncc @psakievich ",
