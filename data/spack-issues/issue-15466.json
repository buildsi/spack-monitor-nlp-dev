    "body": "* Add version 18-08-9-1\r\n* Add variant to allow setting the sysconfdir\r\n\r\nAbout sysconfdir:\r\n\r\nslurm has a server and a client.\r\nTo use the correct communication channel, the client needs to be able to read the correct config.  This config is in PREFIX/etc.\r\n\r\nLet's assume one has the server part installed as a system package. This generally is a good idea, so that the server gets started during boot. This means, that the config is in `/etc/slurm`.\r\n\r\nIf one now wants to use the client part (library!) via spack, one has a problem: spack's slurm looks in `SPACK-PACKAGE-PREFIX/etc` for the config.\r\n\r\nThere needs to be a way to let the spack installed package use the system's config.\r\n\r\nSo add a variant to override the path during build:\r\n`sysconfdir=/etc/slurm`.\r\n\r\nThis is much like what happened in #15307 for munge.",
