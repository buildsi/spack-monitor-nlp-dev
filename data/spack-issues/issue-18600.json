    "body": "@hppritcha , can you have a look at this PR please?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to add `spack external find` support to the openmpi package.  I've been trying to understand the output of `ompi_info`, but I'm having trouble parsing some of it:\r\n\r\n1.) By default, I don't see any way to get access to all the configure command line flags within `ompi_info.`  Therefore, my ability to detect the following variants is limited to the occasional leak of command line arguments:\r\n  * atomics\r\n  * static\r\n  * sqlite3\r\n  * vt\r\n  * singularity\r\n  * lustre\r\n\r\nDo you have a better way of detecting the use of these variants from the output of `ompi_info` ?\r\n\r\n2.) Have I handled parsing the following options from ompi_correctly?\r\n  * Are fabrics always found in the mtl framework?\r\n  * Are schedulers always found in the ras framework?\r\n  * Am I right to use pmi from the ess framework?\r\n  * Have I understood the +memchecker variant correctly?\r\n\r\n3.) Right now I don't have a good way of detecting the 'legacylaunchers' variant, do you have any ideas?",
