    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThis is observed on the spock system, a cray early-access machine at ORNL. It causes several mpi dependent package builds to fail including TAU, which I will use as an example. \r\n\r\npackages.yaml looks like:\r\n\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n    mpich:\r\n      buildable: false\r\n      externals:\r\n      - spec: mpich@8.1.7\r\n        modules:\r\n        - cray-mpich/8.1.7\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe TAU package sets up its mpi configuration like this:\r\n```\r\n            options.append(\"-mpiinc=%s\" % spec['mpi'].prefix.include)\r\n            options.append(\"-mpilib=%s\" % spec['mpi'].prefix.lib)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich translates to this in the actual configure invocation:\r\n`'-mpiinc=/opt/cray/pe/mpich/8.1.7/gtl/include' '-mpilib=/opt/cray/pe/mpich/8.1.7/gtl/lib'`\r\n\r\nHowever, /opt/cray/pe/mpich/8.1.7/gtl/include does not exist. The include files for this mpi install are located in compiler specific subdiriectories of /opt/cray/pe/mpich/8.1.7/ofi and /opt/cray/pe/mpich/8.1.7/ucx. (e.g. /opt/cray/pe/mpich/8.1.7/ofi/gnu/9.1/include)\r\n\r\nThis makes the system-provided mpich impossible to use as an external, at least for packages that use spec['mpi'].prefix.include to get the include path.\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-4019-80713e234c\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.13\r\n* **Platform:** cray-sles15-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
