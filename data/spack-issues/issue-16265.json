    "body": "The file: spack/lib/spack/llnl/util/cpu/microarchitectures.json has 'aes' in the 'features' field for a broadwell cpu. As we understand this field stands for 'Acceleration for Advanced Encryption Standards' not something we care for. In our checkout we drop this feature and everything seem fine. We were just wondering, would you consider dropping this feature from this file as well ? Otherwise, in our broadwell node we get:\r\nspack arch -t\r\nnehalem\r\nas against\r\nbroadwell.\r\n",
