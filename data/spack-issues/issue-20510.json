    "body": "I have a CI pipeline that builds a few packages daily to make sure that they keep building correctly. The CI script includes the following in a function:\r\n\r\n```\r\nspack install $PKGNAME\r\nRET=$?\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe script then reports the value of RET in a log file.\r\n\r\nFor the past week or so, I've been hit by [this issue](https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/20454), effectively making all my packages fail to build because automake-1.16.3 could not be built. The odd thing, however, is that Spack doesn't return an error code when failing to build a package.\r\n\r\nHere is what spack displays (the package I'm trying to build is called mochi-margo):\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Installing automake-1.16.3-2p5gwby4xivgjq2jwv6cnvjs5ou7k2r4\r\n==> No binary for automake-1.16.3-2p5gwby4xivgjq2jwv6cnvjs5ou7k2r4 found: installing from source\r\n==> Using cached archive: /sandbox/jenkins-ci/workspace/Mochi/mochi-all/spack/var/spack/cache/_source-cache/archive/ce/ce010788b51f64511a1e9bb2a1ec626037c6d0e7ede32c1c103611b9d3cba65f.tar.gz\r\n==> automake: Executing phase: 'autoreconf'\r\n==> automake: Executing phase: 'configure'\r\n\r\n==> automake: Executing phase: 'build'\r\n==> Error: ProcessError: Command exited with status 2:\r\n    'make' '-j16'\r\n\r\n2 errors found in build log:\r\n     99       GEN      bin/aclocal-1.16\r\n     100      GEN      doc/aclocal-1.16.1\r\n     101      GEN      bin/automake-1.16\r\n     102      GEN      doc/automake-1.16.1\r\n     103    help2man: can't get `--help' info from aclocal-1.16\r\n     104    Try `--no-discard-stderr' if option outputs to stderr\r\n  >> 105    make: *** [doc/aclocal-1.16.1] Error 126\r\n     106    make: *** Waiting for unfinished jobs....\r\n     107    help2man: can't get `--help' info from automake-1.16\r\n     108    Try `--no-discard-stderr' if option outputs to stderr\r\n  >> 109    make: *** [doc/automake-1.16.1] Error 126\r\n\r\nSee build log for details:\r\n  /sandbox/jenkins-ci/workspace/Mochi/mochi-all/.spack/stage/autotest/spack-stage-automake-1.16.3-2p5gwby4xivgjq2jwv6cnvjs5ou7k2r4/spack-build-out.txt\r\n\r\n==> Warning: Skipping build of mochi-margo-0.9-u7muohgv2xx7ibr2udwusxgzyzwhwtj3 since automake-1.16.3-2p5gwby4xivgjq2jwv6cnvjs5ou7k2r4 failed\r\n```\r\n\r\nAs you can see in the last line, spack skips the installation of the package I asked it to install, and returns 0, making my CI pipeline think that the package was built correctly.",
