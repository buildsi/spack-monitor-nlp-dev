    "body": "As noted by @sbna. He's trying to build a spack package as a CMakePackage as a module for OpenFOAM.  Getting the OpenFOAM environment properly initialized before the build is rather _challenging_.\r\n\r\nIs there a spack-like or cmake-like means of sourcing a shell script prior to starting the cmake?\r\n@alalazo - any experience there?\r\n\r\nIf not, it might be a case of generating a build wrapper ourselves and then calling that. Not really elegant, but might work reliably.\r\n\r\n/mark",
