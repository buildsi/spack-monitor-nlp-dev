    "body": "@tgamblin @alalazo @adamjstewart @davydden \n\nWith the \"new improved\" permissions, we are now able to add labels to Issues and PR's.  GitHub provides the following labels:\n\n> bug\n> duplicate\n> enhancement\n> invalid\n> needs-review\n> needs-work\n> question\n> spec-change\n> will-merge\n> wontfix\n\nThey all seem reasonable; but maybe we can get rid of spec-change.  I propose we add some new labels as well:\n\n**package**: This PR modifies only one or more `package.py` files, not core Spack\n**new**: Add to **package**-labelled PR's to indicate it's a new package no previously in Spack.  (Do we need this?  Not sure)\n**bugfix**: This PR aims to fix a known bug (bug Issue should be referenced in the PR)\n\nThoughts, anyone?  Apparently I can't add new labels, someone at LLNL would need to do that.\n",
