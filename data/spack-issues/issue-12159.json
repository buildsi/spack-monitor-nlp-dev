    "body": "I would love a `spack fetch` option to download a package to the current directory.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWhenever I develop a package, the first thing I do is download the tarball to my Downloads folder so I can poke around. It would help to have a command to automate this.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'm looking for the following functionality:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack fetch foo --local\r\n```\r\nor something like that. We could also have a `--directory` option that defaults to the current directory.",
