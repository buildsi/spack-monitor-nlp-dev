    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nInstalling ESMF fails on the following systems:\r\n1. macOS with apple-clang+gfortran\r\n2. Any system using gfortran-10+\r\n3. Cray systems such as ORNL's Gaea system\r\n\r\nTo repeat:\r\n```\r\nspack install esmf\r\n```\r\non any of these systems.\r\n\r\nAll of these problems are known and have been solved elsewhere (https://github.com/noaa-emc/hpc-stack, https://github.com/JCSDA/jedi-stack).\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\nVarious error messages that are either related to gfortran-10+ (strict argument checking), the use of apple-clang instead of gcc or (llvm-)clang, or being on a cray. For cray, the error is in the final linker step and has to do with the MPI libraries.\r\n\r\nI am not submitting the error logs here, because the problems and the solutions are well known and have been solved elsewhere (https://github.com/noaa-emc/hpc-stack, https://github.com/JCSDA/jedi-stack).\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n1. macOS\r\n```\r\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-1141-bda4216b9a\r\n* **Python:** 3.9.10\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-monterey-x86_64\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n```\r\n2. Cray\r\n```\r\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-1141-bda4216b9a\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.3\r\n* **Platform:** cray-sles15-haswell\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n```\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
