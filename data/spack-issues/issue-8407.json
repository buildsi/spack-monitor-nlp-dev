    "body": "This PR mass-uncomments all `type='test'` dependencies. There are also a couple of other drive-by's (like removing an unnecessary python dependency or so). Note: I haven't tested any of these, and I'm not too sure if doing this en masse is really a good idea. \r\n\r\nFeel free to close if you don't think it is a good idea at all, then I'll take this branch as a source for future work for me. Otherwise I'll point out the packages that I actually mange to get around to build and take it from there",
