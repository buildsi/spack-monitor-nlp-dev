    "body": "The changes in this pull request make the following changes to the `tetgen` package:\r\n\r\n- Fix a bug that was causing memory error after internal failures in `tetgen@1.5.0` installs.\r\n- Add the `+debug` variant, which allows `tetgen` to be configured to be built with or without debug information.\r\n- Add the `+except` variant, which replaces the C asserts in `tetgen` with throw statements to facilitate better error handling when using `tetgen` as a library.\r\n\r\nI've verified that the `tetgen@1.4.3/1.5.0+/~debug+/~except` variants of this package compile and install properly on RHEL6 when compiling with `gcc@4.7.2`.\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if there are any problems with these changes and I'll revise them as soon as I can!",
