    "body": "When trying to build hdf-eos2 using an hdf built with +szip, I get an error during configure\r\nabout lack of an --with-szlib flag.\r\n\r\nIt also looks like the checks for jpeg and zlib libraries will fail if hdf was not built with them\r\n(e.g. using ``` if self.spec['jpeg']:``` instead of ``if 'jpeg' in self.spec:```)\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install hdf-eos2 ^hdf+szip\r\n...\r\nconfigure: error: HDF4 was linked with SZIP, but --with-szlib was not given\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2431-da8039bf29\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-x86_64\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6400592/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6400593/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n\r\nNo maintainers for hdf-eos2, but IIRC I (@payerle) am the one who uploaded the original version.\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x ] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x ] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
