    "body": "Fixes #5156.\r\n\r\n- `_separators` regex in spec.py could be constructed such that '^' came\r\n  first in the character matcher, e.g. '[^@#/]'.  This inverts the match\r\n  and causes transient KeyErrors.\r\n\r\n- Fixed to escape all characters in the constructed regex.\r\n\r\n- This bug comes up in Python3 due to its more randomized hash iteration\r\n  order, but it could probably also happen in a Python 2 implementation.",
