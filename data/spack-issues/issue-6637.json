The url is like \"https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish/releases/download/v2.2.7/jellyfish-2.2.7.tar.gz\". \r\n\r\nWhat I was trying to do is to add this url as list_url:\r\n```python\r\nhomepage = \"http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/\"\r\nurl      = \"http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/jellyfish-1.1.11.tar.gz\"\r\nlist_url = \"https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish/releases/download/\"\r\nlist_depth = 2\r\n```\r\n\r\nBut `spack checksum` cannot find those source code files:\r\n\r\n```console\r\nspack -k checksum jellyfish\r\n==> Warning: You asked for --insecure. Will NOT check SSL certificates.\r\n==> Found 1 version of jellyfish:\r\n\r\n  1.1.11  http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/jellyfish-1.1.11.tar.gz\r\n\r\n==> How many would you like to checksum? (default is 1, q to abort)\r\n```\r\n\r\nOnly 1.1.11 from url is found. \r\n\r\nAnd if the old url is set to be the list_url and the url is set to jellyfish 2.2.7, then spack can find 1.1.11 and 2.2.x.\r\n\r\n```python\r\nhomepage = \"http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/\"\r\nurl      = \"https://github.com/gmarcais/Jellyfish/releases/download/v2.2.7/jellyfish-2.2.7.tar.gz\"\r\nlist_url = \"http://www.cbcb.umd.edu/software/jellyfish/\"\r\n```\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack -k checksum jellyfish\r\n==> Warning: You asked for --insecure.
