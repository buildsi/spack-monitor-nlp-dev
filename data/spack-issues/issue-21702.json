    "body": "Show the maintainer information of a package when its build fails (if the maintainer information is present).\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nAbout half of the open issues on the first few \"Issue\" pages on GitHub relate to build problems instead of problems with Spack itself and some user dump build problems like yesterday with the expectation that\r\n> my understanding is that I report here build errors that I find, which are fixed by the Spack team. Am I correct?\r\n\r\nAs far as I know, the Spack developers do not maintain the build instructions for the software packages that can be built with Spack but this fact is not obvious at all if a user downloaded Spack and ran `. spack/share/spack/setup-env.sh && spack install something`. The only reason I know about this is because I read the packaging tutorials and saw the \"maintainer\" entries.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nMy suggestion to print the maintainer information when a build fails. Example:\r\n```\r\n$ fgrep maintainers spack/var/spack/repo/builtin/packages/something/package.py\r\n    maintainers = [ \"joesixpack1337\", \"janedoe1337\" ]\r\n$ spack install something\r\n./configure\r\n...\r\nError\r\n\r\nThe build of package \"something\" failed. Please contact the GitHub users\r\n  joesixpack1337\r\n  janedoe1337\r\nfor assistance.\r\n\r\nThe Spack developers do *not* maintain this build.\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nSpack v0.16.0, Spack commit 428f8318998f0979918f28ffbb02055895064b74 does not show this information.\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
