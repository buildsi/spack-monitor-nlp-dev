I can think of two general approaches to handle this case:\r\n  * perhaps there should be a \"spack compiler check\" command to make sure no spec is repeated multiple times. Or more likely the check should occur at spack startup\r\n  * (this seems harder) perhaps user-created and system-generated compilers should be able to coexist, and the user-created instance should be used in that case\r\n* a user will be dumped into [user]/[platform]/modules.yaml by default for \"spack config edit modules\", and platform-specific module file generation may be confusing\r\n  * IMO default editing should only be platform-specific for compilers",
