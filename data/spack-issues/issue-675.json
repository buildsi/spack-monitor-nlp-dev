    "body": "I quite like what PETSc guys are doing in their config system, namely checking for blas/lapack symbols for a given package, see for example [hypre](https://bitbucket.org/petsc/petsc/src/90564b43f6b05485163c147b464b5d6d28cde3ef/config/BuildSystem/config/packages/hypre.py?fileviewer=file-view-default#hypre.py-91:93).\n\nI think it's a good feature to have, especially given the variety of Blas/Lapacks. Having that error before trying to build a package is much more descriptive and would save time.\n",
