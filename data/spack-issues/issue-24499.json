    "body": "This PR adds the new version from `ocl-icd` and also for  `opencl-c-headers` and `opencl-clhpp`. I had problems building `ocl-icd` with the  `opencl-c-headers`, because this `ocl-icd` version uses an untagged copy of these headers somewhere between `opencl-c-headers@2020.12.18` and `opencl-c-header@2021.04.29`, so I decided to use an upstream patch, that's also the way, [archlinux](https://github.com/archlinux/svntogit-packages/blob/96a94c57472947d89d468fb81529acdd0844d85d/trunk/PKGBUILD#L27) and [opensuse](https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/900646) builds this packages. Another option would be to use the copy of these headers, which is shipped with `ocl-icd` and can be enabled via the configure script, but I find it cleaner to use the installed headers.",
