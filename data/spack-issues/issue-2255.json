    "body": "This pull request adds a package for the PFFT parallel FFT library, which is based on FFTW and provides MPI-parallel multi-dimensional FFTs, while FFTW itself only implements single-dimensional FFTs in parallel.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it currently requires a patch to be applied to FFTW. This pull request therefore includes changes to add an extra variant to the FFTW package.\r\n\r\nFor details, see the developer's website, https://www-user.tu-chemnitz.de/~potts/workgroup/pippig/software.php.",
