    "body": "This PR involves several changes to the `mxnet` package:\r\n\r\n- [x] Convert to CMakePackage\r\n- [x] Add v1.7.0, v1.x, and master\r\n- [x] Update homepage/url/list_url/git\r\n- [x] Add smoke tests\r\n- [x] Add new variants\r\n- [x] Remove third party deps that aren't used\r\n- [x] Remove patches that are no longer needed\r\n\r\n`mxnet` has supported both Makefile and CMake builds for a while now. It wasn't until 1.7.0 that the CMake build was recommended over the Makefile build, so things may be a bit buggy for 1.3.0 which I didn't test. Starting with 2.X, `mxnet` will no longer support the Makefile build, so now is a good time to switch. I'm deprecating 1.3.0 in #20767 anyway.\r\n\r\nThe Python bindings for `mxnet` are seriously broken. They make assumptions about the location of `libmxnet.(so|dylib)` that are neither true at build-time nor at run-time. At build-time, unless the package is built in `<src-dir>/build`, they can't be found at all. At run-time, we have to use `MXNET_LIBRARY_PATH` to tell the bindings where to find the library, as it looks in the wrong directory.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully installs and passes all import tests on macOS 10.15.7 with Python 3.8.7 and Apple Clang 12.0.0.\r\n\r\nFixes #21327",
