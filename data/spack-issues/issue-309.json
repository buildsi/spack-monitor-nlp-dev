    "body": "This should have all of the functionality we want.\n\nTesting has been somewhat limited by the portability of the packages available for testing, particularly of more complex builds, but the packages that are portable to cray work and the spec concretization works for everything.\n#120 is included in this as some features (support for module-based external dependencies) rely on that feature\n\nIf we choose to change the name of the architecture field I will update the PR\n",
