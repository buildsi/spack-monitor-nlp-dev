    "body": "Successfully installed on SLES 11 (Cray) with CCE 8.5.8.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, I couldn't run the unit tests because of a missing dependency on the kyua testing framework. I started working on a package for kyua but it depends on lutok which depends on lua which depends on ncurses which depends on pkgconf, thereby creating a circular dependency. So I added a note about the missing dependency. I'll \"leave this as an exercise for the reader\" if you really want to properly test pkgconf.\r\n\r\nI did install another package using this pkgconf installation, so I'm confident that it's not too broken.",
