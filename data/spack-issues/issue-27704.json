    "body": "With `SPACK_DISABLE_LOCAL_CONFIG=1` I'm still seeing `spack` touching my user space when bootstrapping. For example, `spack` created `/users/treddy/.spack/bootstrap/config` and it was confusing me because it was not respecting my instance scope environment settings for compilers to use and so on.\r\n\r\nCould we make `SPACK_DISABLE_LOCAL_CONFIG=1` an even stronger guarantee of ignoring/never writing to the local scope, even for bootstrapping?",
