    "body": "In a spack environment I included a compiler definition and used the microarchitecture target broadwell and spack was unable to find it.  Replacing it with x86_64 allowed it to work.  Seems like the target cannot be a specific microarchitecture.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\ncreate an environment, add a compiler block, and use a target=broadwell\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nSpack will fail to find the compiler\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\n 1. LLNL LC pascal\r\n\r\n",
