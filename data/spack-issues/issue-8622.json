    "body": "- [x] Speed up locking a bit by disabling the debug info we write to lock files by default.\r\n  - Can still construct a lock with `debug=True`, but we no longer write to/read from the lock file every time we acquire a lock.\r\n- [x] Clean up error messages for when a lock can't be created, or when an exclusive (write) lock can't be taken on a file.\r\n- [x] Add a number of subclasses of LockError to distinguish timeouts from permission issues.\r\n- [x] Add an explicit check to tell the user they're taking a write lock on a read-only file.\r\n  - We had a check for this for when we try to *upgrade* a lock on an RO file, but not for an initial write lock attempt.\r\n- [x] Add more tests for different lock permission scenarios.\r\n- [x] Separate tests for `spack.util.lock` from `llnl.util.lock`, and move `spack.util.multiproc` to `llnl.util.multiproc`\r\n",
