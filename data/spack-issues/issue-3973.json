    "body": "We're just starting to use Lmod here at ANL and I'm testing out Spack's module support. So far I've built `intel-parallel-studio` with the system GCC, then I built `mvapich2` with this Intel compiler. This results in:\r\n```\r\n$ module avail\r\n...\r\nCore/intel-parallel-studio/professional.2017.2\r\nintel/17.0.2/mvapich2/2.2\r\n...\r\n```\r\nNow when I try to load them:\r\n```\r\n$ module load Core/intel-parallel-studio/professional.2017.2\r\n$ module load intel/17.0.2/mvapich2/2.2\r\n\r\nLmod is automatically replacing \"Core/intel-parallel-studio/professional.2017.2\" with\r\n\"intel/17.0.2/mvapich2/2.2\".\r\n```\r\nI understand that Lmod has a nice feature that prevents you from loading multiple libraries built with different compilers, but I thought that putting things in `Core` would allow it to work. What am I missing here?\r\n\r\nFor reference, my `modules.yaml` looks like:\r\n```yaml\r\nmodules:\r\n  enable::\r\n    - lmod\r\n    - tcl\r\n  lmod:\r\n    core_compilers:\r\n      - 'gcc@4.8.5'\r\n    hash_length: 0\r\n```\r\n@alalazo?",
