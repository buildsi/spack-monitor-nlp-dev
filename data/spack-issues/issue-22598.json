    "body": "Fixes #22436.\r\n\r\n`spack config blame` was not printing all lines of configuration because there were no annotations for empty lines in the YAML dump output.\r\n\r\n- [x] Fix by removing empty lines. It doesn't seem like Ruamel YAML allows us many other options.\r\n- [x] Add a better test that checks that line numbers are correct\r\n- [x] Also fix printing of `null` values in YAML output while we're at it.",
