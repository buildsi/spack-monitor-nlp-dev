    "body": "* depends_on('m4') is obsolete with depends_on('autoconf'):\r\n  - Remove `m4` from the example depends_on() lines for the autoreconf phase.\r\n  - Change the branch used as example from develop to master as it is\r\n    far more common in the packages of spack's builtin repo.\r\n\r\n* Fix the wrong info that libtoolize and aclocal are run explicitly\r\n  in the autoreconf phase by default. autoreconf calls these internally\r\n  as needed, thus autotools.py also does not call them directly.\r\n\r\n* Add that autoreconf() also adds -I<aclocal-prefix>/share/aclocal.\r\n\r\n* Add an example how to set autoreconf_extra_args.\r\n\r\n* Add an example of a custom autoreconf phase for running autogen.sh.",
