    "body": "This PR was inspired by #28679. In this issue, a user reported that Spack was choosing a random `cuda_arch` value and that value was not supported by MAGMA. This PR explicitly documents which `cuda_arch` values are supported and when support for those was added.\r\n\r\nP.S. I removed the `cuda_arch=37` patch I added for MAGMA 2.5.4 because there are now newer versions of MAGMA that support `cuda_arch=37`. Let me know if you want me to undo this removal.",
