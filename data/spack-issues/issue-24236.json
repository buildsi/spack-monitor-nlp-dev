    "body": "This allows users to source `setup-env.*sh` but skip the modules configuration steps if `SPACK_SKIP_MODULES` is set. On my system, with 2K+ packages installed, this cuts source time down from 6+ sec to 1 sec, which makes a big difference if you source `setup-env.*sh` on startup.\r\n\r\nUpdated both `setup-env.sh` and `setup-env.fish`. `setup-env.csh` doesn't seem to have this option.",
