    "body": "The manual states that preferred variants can be added to the packages.yaml file:\n\nhttp://software.llnl.gov/spack/configuration.html#concretization-preferences\n\n> Spack can be configured to prefer certain compilers, package versions, depends_on, and **variants** during concretization. \n\nbut later on it says the only options are \"compiler, version, or providers\", and there is no mention of variants in the config schema for packages.\n\nI propose that users may select preferred variants to be used either for direct or indirect installation using the following example:\n\n```\npackages:\n  python:\n    variants: ['+ucs4']\n  octave:\n    variants: ['+fftw', '+curl', '+qt']\n```\n\nThese preferences are only used if they do not conflict with a variant required by the dependency tree, or specified by the user.\n",
