    "body": "According to the [documentation on spack find](http://software.llnl.gov/spack/basic_usage.html#spack-find):\n\n> `spack find -l +debug` will find every installed package with a \u2018debug\u2019 compile-time option enabled.\n\nBut this is not true. Spack currently requires a package name. Until this functionality is enabled, I'm going to remove this text from the documentation so as not to confuse new users.\n\nThis bug was discovered while working on #1576. It will be fixed in #1576. This issue is being opened to track the problem.\n",
