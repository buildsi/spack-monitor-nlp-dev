    "body": "Since zsh can load bash completion files natively, seems reasonable to just turn this on.  The only changes are to switch from `type -t` which zsh doesn't support to using `type` with a regex and adding a new arm to the sourcing of the completions to allow it to work for zsh as well as bash.\r\n\r\nCould use more bash/dash/etc testing probably, but everything I've thought to try has worked so far.",
