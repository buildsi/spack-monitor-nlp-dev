    "body": "As mentioned in #1980, adding default compiler configuration for BG-Q platform.\r\n\r\n@tgamblin : I am verifying these defaults on 4 bg-q systems that I have access to: MIRA, JUQUEEN, BG-Q @ EPFL and BG-Q @ CSCS. The only exception is XL compilers (`xl@12.1`) on MIRA which is installed under `/soft/compilers/....`. What about Sequoia @ LLNL?\r\n\r\nI think these defaults are fine for *\"most\"* the bg-q systems. \r\n",
