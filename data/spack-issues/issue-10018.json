    "body": "SAGA is a GIS for Automated Geoscientific Analyses and has been designed for an easy and effective implementation of spatial algorithms.  It offers a comprehensive, growing set of geoscientific methods and provides an easily approachable user interface with many visualisation options. It offers both a cmd (for batch jobs) and a gui mode as well.\r\n\r\nThe most recent dependencies of saga-gis include at-spi2-core, which is built with meson, which requires python3.

Don't know if there is a better solution available...",
