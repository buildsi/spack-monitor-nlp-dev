    "body": "When I run \"spack arch\" it returns nephalem and not the expected x86_64 i'm used to. It used to return x86_64 but at some point it changed. This is on a Samsung notebook with a Intel I7 CPU. I have Ubuntu Mate 19.04 installed. Also tried Ubuntu Mate 18.04 with the same result.\r\n\r\nWhen I ignore the fact that it's not x86_64 and continue to install packages such as cmake, the compilation will fail.\r\nThis all used to work. I even reinstalled the OS but the issue still exists.\r\n\r\nI followed this page to install spack and packages:\r\nhttps://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/getting_started.html\r\n",
