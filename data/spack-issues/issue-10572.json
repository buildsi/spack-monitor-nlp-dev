    "body": "Considering how few mandatory dependencies Eigen has, it is a shame that Spack's Eigen package pulls in so many barely relevant dependencies by default, and requires users who care about their Docker image sizes and package build times to disable all of them one by one.\r\n\r\nI would therefore propose to change the default to a more bare-bones Eigen install, and let those who are interested in Eigen's integration with various optional dependencies ask for them using the relevant variants.",
