    "body": "Fixes #2069.\r\n\r\nSpack will now validate whether packages in `packages.yaml` exist or not, and it won't let you inadvertently put a virtual in `packages.yaml`.  See #2069 for details.\r\n\r\n- Small refactoring:\r\n  - [x] rename `preferred_packages` to `package_prefs` -- latter encompassed better all the things `packages.yaml` can do.\r\n  - [x] Consolidate all code to handle `packages.yaml` into `packages_prefs.py`\r\n- Fix bugs\r\n  - [x] Spack validates and dies now if you specify something virtual in `packages.yaml`.\r\n  - [x] Add tests to verify this.\r\n\r\n@alalazo @davydden",
