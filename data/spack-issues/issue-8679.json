    "body": "Closes #8678 \r\n\r\nThe `py-dev` package is no longer available on PyPI, or has been renamed. There are currently no packages in Spack that depend on this package. It was added in #3533 because it was supposedly a dependency of TensorFlow, but if you look at the [installation instructions](https://www.tensorflow.org/install/install_sources), it runs `apt-get python-dev`, which is the development headers for Python, not the `dev` Python library.\r\n\r\n@jcftang @Novermars",
