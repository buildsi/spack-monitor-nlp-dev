    "body": "Add a package for sniffles.\r\n\r\nAs this package stands, the only thing that it installs is a copy of `libz.a`.\r\n\r\nI *think* that the problem is that the cmake config files don't set up an install target.  Or perhaps it's broken.  I'm not cmake-savvy enough to tell.\r\n\r\n[Here are the installation instructions](https://github.com/fritzsedlazeck/Sniffles/wiki#how-to-build-sniffles).\r\n\r\nBefore I do something silly, like `mkdir prefix.bin` and then `cp ../bin/sniffles*/sniffles prefix.bin`, is there a better way?",
