    "body": "In perl-tk, file ptked uses a copyright symbol (&copy;) that is not UTF-8, leading the post-install hook in spack/lib/spack/spack/test/sbang.py to fail.\r\nOne could modify the spack core file sbang.py (PR #24231) or modify the ptked file in package perl-tk.\r\nOne can also do both, in case other packages were concerned.\r\nAt least for perl-tk, this current PR solves the problem.\r\nAlso added git repo https://github.com/eserte/perl-tk.git and a new version 804.036.\r\nI will add myself as maintainer following recommandations from @tldahlgren in \r\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RlczUgwFCJg&t=21125s\r\nIf I may, I think @alalazo is used to deal with the UTF-8 aspect so I would be happy to be reviewed by him.",
