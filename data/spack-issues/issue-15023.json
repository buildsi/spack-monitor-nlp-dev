    "body": "Cache specs recently concretized using `spack spec` so that they can be looked up via their hash.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWhen preparing to install new software, it's common to use `spack spec -l` to compare hashes against installed hashes to see what new packages/variants would be installed and why they differ from already installed ones. This will also make it easier to diff a potential installed package and an existing package.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nCache recently concretized specs (maybe LRU with configurable size, maybe with an \"expire\" time) so that `spack spec -l /blah` would work if `blah` had just showed up in the previous spec command. This is useful because the dependencies of `blah` might be truncated depending on what was printed earlier in the root DAG.\r\n",
