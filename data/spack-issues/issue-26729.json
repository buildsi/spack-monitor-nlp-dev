    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nWhile trying to package ruby extensions for spack, I encountered several dependency issues between gems. They are related to how `GEM_PATH` is handled by spack and by Ruby `gem`.\r\n - Arguably `GEM_PATH` and `PYTHONPATH` should be treated similarly, so I mimicked how python is dealing with `PYTHONPATH`\r\n - Not using the `--install-dir` option of `gem` (relying on `GEM_HOME` to set it), causes `GEM_PATH` to be removed from the environment, so I added the `--install-dir` option to `gem install`. See below link for the problematic line of code.\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/blob/4ebde70687e5ec158537e852a34ac3cae1674647/lib/rubygems/commands/install_command.rb#L160\r\n\r\nThis fixes my issues and allows gems dependencies to be resolved at build time. I am very unfamiliar with spack, so I may have ended far the correct solution though.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nBrice",
