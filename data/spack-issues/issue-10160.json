    "body": "Add 'v9.3.2-auto.patch'.  This patch changes some 'auto t: type' usage\r\nto the older but equivalent 'type.begin()'.  This allows building\r\ndyninst 9.3.2 with gcc 4.4 which doesn't support the newer syntax.\r\nThis patch is harmless with newer gcc.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis patch allows building dyninst 9.3.2 on Blue Gene with the default\r\ngcc 4.4 compiler (which is why I care).\r\n\r\nI can make dyninst 10.0.0 build on Blue Gene, but it requires a patch\r\nto elfutils and the 4.8 compiler.\r\n",
