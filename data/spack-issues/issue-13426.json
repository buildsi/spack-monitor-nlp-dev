    "body": "\r\nWhile building `py-jupyter-notebook` (and its dependencies, of which this is one) I accidentally wrote a dependency restriction like this:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndepends_on('py-traitlets@5.0:@5.0:`)\r\n```\r\n\r\nI would assume this to end up with a syntax error, but it didn't. I'm unsure what would happen if the two versions would be different or even mutually exclusive. Opening this issue to have a place to write down further investigation (though I'm not sure when I'll get to that)",
