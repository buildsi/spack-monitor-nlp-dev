    "body": "I submitted #17439 to test a PR with changes to Spack's core on the e4s pipeline. This was great, since it detected a bug that slipped through unit tests. \r\n\r\nI just want to report that the bug was during the construction of the build environment resulting in errors like [this one](https://cdash.spack.io/viewConfigure.php?buildid=13980). On the PR I never got an error reported, but the pipeline was hanging in the \"pending for notifications\" state until I push forced a fix.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nAn example of a commit which was exposing the bug is: 8a15740a2. Submit a PR at that commit and wait for the pipeline to report back on Github.\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\nLooking at the corresponding dashboard [this error message](https://cdash.spack.io/viewConfigure.php?buildid=13980) and many other similar ones have been logged, but the outcome has never been reported as an error. The pipeline doesn't fail and stays pending on Github.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nNot relevant.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n",
