    "body": "Refactor compression strategies and conventions for Windows support. These changes do not actually depend on anything in the Windows feature branch, so this PR is targeted at develop to expediate Windows integration into develop down the road.\r\n\r\nChanges: Update BZ2 and unzip unpacking strategies to support zipfiles and move away from reliance on unix CL tools.\r\n \r\nDiscussed updates: Updates to prevent bz2 compressed tarballs from hanging on Windows, and do not require Windows users to have unix cl utilities available on the path. Refactor decompression function signature. Refactor decompression strategies for extension as required by the Windows refactor.",
