We'll see if this PR fairs any better. Interestingly, I'm already seeing weird differences. Normally, when I push a PR to my repo, if I go to https://github.com/LLNL/spack or https://github.com/ajstewart/spack, GitHub will ask if I want to open a new PR. This time, it didn't. I had to go to my branches and manually create a PR. Maybe it's the commit message or branch name?",
