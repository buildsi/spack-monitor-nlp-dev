    "body": "This fixes the last bug (noted by @scheibelp and me) in `overwrite: True` installs. In the unlikely case where both `spack install --overwrite` (or `spack install` with develop specs) fails and Spack can't restore the backup of the original prefix, we should reflect in the database that the original spec is uninstalled.\r\n\r\nIt's hard to add a test for this since it's not very modular code... The last 3 commits are the ones that matter.",
