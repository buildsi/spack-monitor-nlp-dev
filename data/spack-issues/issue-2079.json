You can find those on Linux by looking at /etc/ld.so.conf, and on Mac OS X the default search paths are embedded in dyld: /Library/Frameworks:/Network/Library/Frameworks:/System/Library/Frameworks and /usr/local/lib:/lib:/usr/lib. Not sure why /lib is preferred over /usr/lib, but whatever. We should just have the build environment exclude these from the automatic -I, -L, and -Wl,-rpath args. They'll still be found, but at a lower precedence than the ones supplied in args.\n> \n> ...look at:\n> lib/spack/spack/build_environment.py\n> lib/spack/spack/test/cc\n> lib/spack/env/cc\n\nfrom https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/2067#issuecomment-255410058\n",
