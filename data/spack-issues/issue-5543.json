    "body": "closes #5473\r\n\r\nPrior to this PR we were not exiting early for external packages, which caused the `configure_options` property of the contexts to fail with e.g. a key error because the DAG gets truncated for them. More importantly Spack configure options don't make any sense for externals.\r\n\r\nNow we exit early, and leave a message in the module file clarifying that this package has been installed outside of Spack.",
