    "body": "This PR makes an effort to bridge the gap in the Windows function of python's `get_config_vars` method in `sysconfig` from the Unix function. Unix implementation exposes dramatically more information.\r\n\r\nThis PR fills in install config info as best as is able, or simply fills in an empty string to allow other packages to query Python's configuration without KeyErrors while still indicating an issue.\r\n\r\nThis PR is necessary to install/bootstrap Ninja and Clingo on Windows",
