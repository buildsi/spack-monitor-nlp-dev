    "body": "Commit 78724357 added versions 2019.5 to 2019.8 but failed to update\r\nthe patches for these versions.\r\n\r\n1. gcc_generic-pedantic patch -- include this up through 2019.5.  This\r\nwas fixed in the TBB source tree in 2019.6.\r\n\r\n2. tbb_cmakeConfig patch -- this needs to be modified (different file)\r\nfor 2019.5 and later.\r\n\r\n3. tbb_gcc_rtm_key patch -- replace this with filter_file.  This is\r\nsimpler and eliminates the need to update the patch whenever the\r\nsurrounding context changes.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nping @chissg and @odoublewen who wrote these patches and may want to\r\ncheck my work.",
