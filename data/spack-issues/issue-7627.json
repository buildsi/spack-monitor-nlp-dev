    "body": "When building `tut` with Python 3, I see the following error message:\r\n```\r\n  File \"waftools/gcov.py\", line 16\r\n    os.chmod(wrapper.name, 0777)\r\n                              ^\r\nSyntaxError: invalid token\r\n```\r\nIn Python 2, integers that start with a leading 0 are interpreted as octals. In Python 3, this is not the case, and the number must start with 0o or else it will be a SyntaxError. This patch allows me to build `tut` with Python 3. I also confirmed that it still works for Python 2. All build tests pass.\r\n\r\nI submitted this patch upstream as well: https://github.com/mrzechonek/tut-framework/pull/15",
