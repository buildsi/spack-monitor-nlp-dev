    "body": "### Actual Result\r\n\r\nSuppose a and b have a dependency on c, and that c is already installed\r\n`spack install a b` will print\r\n`==> c is already installed in [...]` twice, instead of once\r\n\r\n### Expected Result\r\n\r\nSpack will enumerate all dependencies (and check for conflicts) before processing anything in the `spack install` list, like apt does\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nFor example\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install r-a4 r-a4base\r\n```\r\nwill enumerate all `r` dependencies twice\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\npascal at llnl, but I expect this to not be system dependent.",
