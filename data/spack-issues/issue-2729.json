    "body": "I'm going through Spack tutorials on Cent OS 7 with GCC 4.8.5. All work haven been done on spack v0.9.1 release. \r\n\r\nI find that `install_tree` customized in `~/.spack/config.yaml` doesn't take effect. Installation still goes into `$SPACK_ROOT/opt/spack`.\r\n\r\nDocuments seem a bit out-of-date which reflect the following changes in spack-v0.9.1.\r\n\r\n1. There is no `etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml` file now. (http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_yaml.html)\r\n2. `config` is not an acceptable option for `spack config get` now. (http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/configuration.html)\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack config get compilers\r\ncompilers:\r\n  linux-x86_64:\r\n    gcc@4.8.5:\r\n      cc: /usr/bin/gcc\r\n      cxx: /usr/bin/g++\r\n      f77: /usr/bin/gfortran\r\n      fc: /usr/bin/gfortran\r\n\r\n$ spack config get config\r\n==> Error: Invalid config section: 'config'.
