    "body": "I would like to ask several questions about 'blas' and 'lapack' virtual dependencies.\r\n\r\nLet's start with the [documentation](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html?highlight=virtual#blas-and-lapack-libraries). It tells us that we should use blas_libs and lapack_libs properties to avoid hard-coding. 'mkl-intel' has those properties but 'openblas' doesn't (anymore). Does it mean that we still have to do hard-coding to find out whether we should get libraries from spec['blas'].libs or speck['blas'].blas_libs? Or should we just wrap openblas's libs property with blas_libs?\r\n\r\nMy second question is about C interfaces of the libraries: cblas, clapack, and lapacke (are there more)? How can I tell spack that my package needs not just 'lapack' but 'lapacke' or 'clapack'? And how do I get a list of additional libraries that enable the interface (if by any chance they are required)?\r\n\r\nThank you.",
