    "body": "A long time ago, the Acts project (whose name was then capitalized ACTS) used\r\nto maintain multiple software repositories:\r\n\r\n- The heart of the tracking toolkit was located in the `acts-core` repository\r\n- Fast simulation extensions were located in the `acts-fatras` repository\r\n- Advanced usage examples were located in the `acts-framework` repository\r\n\r\nThis multi-repository organization, however, has been a source of constant\r\npain, which is why the various projects were gradually merged into a single\r\nmono-repo, called `acts`. Today, with the integration of `acts-framework`,\r\nthis merging process is reaching completion.\r\n\r\nThe present pull request adapts the Acts package to this evolution by...\r\n\r\n- Renaming the package to `acts`, reflecting the new repository name\r\n- Renaming the `test` variant to `unit_tests`, reflecting current CMake naming\r\n- Adding the new build variants that were inherited from `acts-framework`\r\n- Acknowledging the change of semantics of the `examples` variant, and only\r\n  supporting the new ones (as the former variant was almost unused)\r\n- Liberally using alphabetical order to make the package code more readable\r\n- Recording a large number of conflicts, some of which are introduced by the\r\n  merging of `acts-framework` and some of which already existed before\r\n- Using the new capitalization of \"Acts\"\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2020-05-05:** Added acts v0.23, which is the first release that incorporates these changes.\r\n\r\n**EDIT 2020-05-07:** Added acts v0.22.1, a [very minor bugfix](https://github.com/acts-project/acts/releases/tag/v0.22.01).",
