    "body": "To be entirely correct, a compiler from a module should include a\r\n'modules:' field in its entry in the compilers.yaml file.  By default,\r\nspack doesn't add this field automatically, so add a note about adding\r\nit manually.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nThis is a followup to Issue #9376.  This confused me for a long time\r\nwhere I thought that --dirty was the only workaround.  So, I thought\r\nthat an note about an explicit manual step made sense.\r\n",
