    "body": "There is no error or warning by environments if the `spack.yaml` file has an `include` entry that does not exist.  The reason is the missing entries are treated as if they are files and assumed to specify `SingleFileScopes`.  \r\n\r\nThis PR terminates execution with an error that includes the missing path(s).  For example, the output with this PR is:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Error: Detected 2 missing include path(s):\r\n   $HOME/spack/clean/spacktest/A\r\n   $HOME/spack/clean/spacktest/B\r\nPlease correct and try again.\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhen the two include paths do not exist.\r\n\r\n(Note: Adrien Bernede requested a fix to this issue in the `#environments` slack channel.  )",
