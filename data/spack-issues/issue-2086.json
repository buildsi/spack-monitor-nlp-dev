    "body": "This would fix #2085 and might affect #2055 as well.  The proposal is...\n\nWhen installing package `xyz`, set up the environment by loading all the modules listed in `spack module loads xyz` before running the `install()` procedure.  This is in contrast to the current system, where the build environment is set up \"by hand,\" based on assumptions on how installed Spack packages work.\n\nI expect this proposal would have little or no discernable effect for most Spack packages that install standard compiled code.  But it would really improve (for example) a lot of Python builds.  See #2085 for details...\n",
