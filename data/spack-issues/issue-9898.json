    "body": "H5Z-ZFP uses non-empty ``FC`` variable to decide whether to build its fortran interface. If ``FC`` is defined in environment, then it will have the effect of causing H5Z-ZFP to build its fortran interface even if, for example, the dependent HDF5 library was not built with its fortran features enabled (which are required by H5Z-ZFP's fortran interface). By explicitly setting ``FC`` to empty on the H5Z-ZFP make command-line, we effectively disable building of its fortran interface.",
