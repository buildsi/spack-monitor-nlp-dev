    "body": "Hey folks,\r\n\r\nI've updated a few sections of the documentation for SC17. I've rearranged one section, and added sections on topics which aren't much discussed elsewhere. These are all things I had trouble figuring out on my own, and I think the documentation would benefit from having them in there.\r\n\r\nTopics include:\r\n- Better enumeration of a spec objects abilities\r\n- Examples of packages to use for inspiration\r\n- Another mention of using the `run_before` and `run_after` decorators\r\n- How to get configuration variables within spack\r\n- How to change or add configuration variables to spack\r\n- How to execute command line programs\r\n- A small mention about how hashes are calculated.\r\n\r\nGive me feedback on formatting and content.",
