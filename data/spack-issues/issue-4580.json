    "body": "So, I've used Spack to install a bunch of packages I need. Its great and easy to use to do it.\r\n\r\nNow, I wanna used the packages I have installed to build an application. For example, I have an MFEM package that uses many of MFEM's optional variant packages which you can see installed here.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[scratlantis:mfem/mfem-3.3/examples] miller86% spack find mfem petsc hypre sundials metis superlu-dist netcdf suite-sparse blas mpi\r\n==> 25 installed packages.\r\n-- darwin-elcapitan-x86_64 / gcc@6.1.0 --------------------------\r\nhypre@2.11.2   metis@5.1.0          openblas@0.2.19  suite-sparse@4.5.5  sundials@2.7.0\r\nhypre@2.11.2   mfem@3.3             openmpi@2.1.1    suite-sparse@4.5.5  superlu-dist@5.1.3\r\nhypre@develop  mfem@3.3             petsc@3.7.6      sundials@2.6.2      superlu-dist@develop\r\nhypre@develop  netcdf@4.4.1.1       petsc@develop    sundials@2.6.2      superlu-dist@develop\r\nhypre@develop  netlib-lapack@3.6.1  petsc@develop    sundials@2.7.0      veclibfort@0.4.2\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow, how do I find the paths to the set of packages I need to compile and link my MFEM application? There are multiple installations of hypre and petsc for example (I think they have same spec).\r\n\r\nI would like to do something like `spack paths mfem` that returns a list of header paths for header files for all packages mfem depends on and a list of library paths for same. I have done my own thing using `spack find -p` but the problem is that in the install point (above), there are multiple instances matching a spec and my script is picking a wrong instance.",
