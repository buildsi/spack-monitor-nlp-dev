    "body": "Fixes #2044.\n\nThis PR adds the patch from the [bug report](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=69959) found by @svenevs in #2044. From what I understand, the problem is that GCC 6 defaults to `-std=gnu++14`, but older versions of GCC don't comply with this standard. An alternative solution would be to use `CXXFLAGS=\"-std=gnu++98\"` when compiling older versions of GCC, but I opted for the patch because that's what GCC did upstream.\n\nWhy would you want to build GCC 5 if you already have a GCC 6 compiler? The main use case is on bleeding-edge OSes like Fedora, where you only have GCC 6.2.0, but software like CUDA only supports up to GCC 5.3.0.\n\nTesting: I successfully installed GCC 5.3.0 with GCC 6.2.0 on macOS. I also made sure that the patch applied for all versions of GCC between 4.7 and 5.3. Pre-4.7, we would either have to use `CXXFLAGS=\"-std=gnu++98\"` or come up with another patch.\n\n@svenevs If you want to test this, it should now work on both Fedora and macOS for you.\n",
