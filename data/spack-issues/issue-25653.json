    "body": "This issue addresses \"MOAR SPECK PROBLEMS\" (more spack problems) as reported by https://repology.org/repository/spack/problems. After this is reviewed and merged I'll follow up with adding a check to audit so we won't let in packages/package updates that have a working https URL.\r\n\r\nNot all of them on that page are fixable - some of these are not resolvable in that there is only an http page available, or a page reported as broken is actually ok, or a page has an SSL error that does not prevent one from visiting (and no good replacement). Anyway, tiny steps! I suppose this is like untangling hair where we get our the big knots first and then zoom in on the smaller ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
