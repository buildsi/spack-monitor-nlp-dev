    "body": "This PR introduces a patch to the metis package which changes the `cmake_minimum_required` from `2.8` to `3.2`. The reasoning for this is that on macOS the rpath default settings are more reasonable on cmake version `3.2.`.\r\n\r\nThe patch is only applied on macOS and when an appropriate cmake version is available.",
