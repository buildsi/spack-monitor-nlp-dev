    "body": "Some Python packages install python scripts to be executed via bash.\nIf we use the Python installed with `spack`, the path of the python is something like:\n`#!/<SOME_DIR>/spack_git_repo/opt/spack/chaos_5_x86_64_ib/gcc-4.4.7/python-2.7.10-              yqkr6m74axh3nafjscgtjb3zj3htx3fe/bin/python`\n\nSomehow the bash interpreter will cut it off when the shebang is longer than a certain number of characters as documented [here](http://www.in-ulm.de/~mascheck/various/shebang/#issues)\n\nFor me it cut off so the she-bang looked like:\n``#!/<SOME_DIR>/spack_git_repo/opt/spack/chaos_5_x86_64_ib/gcc-4.4.7/python-2.7.10-              yqkr6m74axh3nafjscgtjb3zj3htx3fe/bin/p`\n\nA simple fix is to change the line of shebang to:\n`#!/bin/env python` \n\nIs there a better solution than manually changing all the shebangs for the python scripts?\nIn any case, I thought it may be nice to document this behavior somewhere in the `spack` documentation for Python use.\nThanks.\n",
