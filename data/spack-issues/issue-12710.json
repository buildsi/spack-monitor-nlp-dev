    "body": "The \"mirrors\" section of \"spack.yaml\" should support file paths that are relative to the spack.yaml.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nI have some dependencies I've \"vendored\" into my source control via a spack mirror for systems where those dependencies aren't accessible. I'd like the included spack environment to point to that mirror. Currently mirrors can not be to a relative path.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nAllow relative file paths in the mirrors section of spack.yaml\r\n",
