    "body": "This is a rough first draft of a MATLAB package. Honestly, I'm surprised no one has done this yet.\r\n\r\n**Caveats**\r\n\r\nMATLAB is very picky about how you install it. You need to provide it with a license file, and either log in to your MathWorks account through the GUI or provide a file installation key, and maybe a separate activation phase? This is my first time installing MATLAB from the command line, so if you have more experience than I do, please chime in.\r\n\r\n1. I couldn't get the silent installation working. The silent installation is the only way to install MATLAB if you don't have internet access or you can't open the GUI, so I would love to figure it out. It basically told me it didn't find any files to install, leading me to believe that you have to download them manually first. A good use case for resources, if we could download them easily.\r\n2. If you run the automated installation, it skips over the steps you specify, but also skips over some that you don't, making it impossible to log in to your MathWorks account. I couldn't get a working file installation key, so this is as far as I got.\r\n3. The interactive installation is the only one I've had any luck with. Unfortunately, depending on your OS and X11 support, none of the text in the GUI will show up for you. I had to run it on two separate machines just so I could tell what each button and text field meant.\r\n4. Eventually I finally got it to install. It made it to the post_install hooks and symlinked the license properly. And then Spack hung. I have no idea what is preventing it from finishing properly. @tgamblin Any ideas? Could the GUI not be completely dead, and that's causing the forked process not to terminate?\r\n5. Eventually we will need to make MATLAB extendable, although it doesn't need to be done in this PR.\r\n6. Even once this is all working, I'm not sure variants are the right way to do things. The `mode` you choose doesn't really affect the installation. And the `key` results in your file installation key being preserved in the hash. Although this lets you install multiple installations if you have more than one license like we do. I suggested an [alternative solution](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/2566#issuecomment-266521694), but it sounds like this isn't the easiest thing to get working.",
