    "body": "Improvements over the previous version of the package:\n- adds variant support for different process managers (`slurm`, `hydra`, `gforker`, `remshell`)\n- adds variant support for different network types\n\nStill lacks CUDA support. The url for version `1.9` and `2.0` seems to be broken and were kept only for compatibility reasons.\n",
