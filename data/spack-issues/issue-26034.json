    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nWhen two different operating systems have the same spack installation the `spack compiler` command can handle this correctly, but not the `spack external find` command. \r\nSo it is not possible to use external libraries in conjunction with different operating systems even when setting the operating system explicitly in `.spack/packages.yaml`\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\nNo explicit error message, as spack does not spec out this correclty\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nI saw this issue when trying to comparing a `sles-12-sp4` with a `sles-15-sp3`",
