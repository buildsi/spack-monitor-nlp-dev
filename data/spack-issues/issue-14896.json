    "body": "Dear Developers,\r\n\r\nI encountered an issue about .spack directory created by spack:\r\nCurrently spack shares the same directory $HOME/.speck/linux it created whether working on IBM Power or x86_64 machines in the same NFS, which could be an issue when switching to a machine of a different platform to work on. Is it possible to allow user to specify it as a different directory through environment variable?\r\n\r\nBest \r\nShelton      ",
