    "body": "The documentation of external packages has an example\n\n```\npackages:\n   openmpi:\n      paths:\n         openmpi@1.4.3%gcc@4.4.7=chaos_5_x86_64_ib: /opt/openmpi-1.4.3\n```\n\nFor the life of mine I could not make it work to set up system's blas/lapack and avoid Spack trying to install `openblas` as a dependency for `hypre`. I tried something along these lines\n\n```\npackages:\n  blas:\n    paths:\n      blas: <system>\n    buildable: False\n  lapack:\n    paths:\n      lapack: <system>\n    buildable: False\n```\n\nwhich would be my na\u00efve interpretation of the documentation.\n\n~~Btw, the `hypre`'s blas-related configure is not correct as it assumes blas-lapack names as `blas` and `lapack`~~\n\n```\nconfigure_args = [\n                \"--prefix=%s\" % prefix,\n                \"--with-lapack-libs=lapack\",\n                \"--with-lapack-lib-dirs=%s/lib\" % lapack_dir,\n                \"--with-blas-libs=blas\",\n                \"--with-blas-lib-dirs=%s/lib\" % blas_dir]\n```\n\n~~which is certainly not the case for `openblas`.~~\nI see that you symlink `libbas` and `liblapack` when installing openblas. However, this is not a flexible enough solution for things like MKL.  It goes back to the issue https://github.com/LLNL/spack/issues/234 . \n",
