    "body": "Adds a test to ensure that versions like `3.1,3.1.1:3.1.2` do not throw when constructed.\n\nCurrently Spack interprets the Version `3.1` as the VersionRange `3.1:3.1` and then simplifies the VersionList to `3.1:3.1` as `3.1.1:3.1.2` is included in the range already.\n\nThat is a bug, but at least the buggy behavior is better than Spack raising an error when trying to construct `3.1,3.1.1:3.1.2`.\n\n\n",
