    "body": "Currently Spack simplifies the range `3:3` incorrectly to the concrete version `3`: `Spec('python@3:3')` becomes `python@3` during version list simplification.\r\n\r\nThe reason is that `VersionRange::concrete()` incorrectly returns a concrete version when start == end.\r\n\r\n`3:3` means the closed-open range `[3, 4)` just like `3:4` means `[3, 5)` and `3:3.0` means `[3, 3.1)`.\r\n\r\nThis PR ensures that a VersionRange is never considered concrete, and adds tests for 3:3, 3:4, 3:2 type of ranges.\r\n\r\nAfter this PR, `spack spec something ^python@3:3` can be used to require the optimal Python 3 and avoid Python 2.\r\n",
