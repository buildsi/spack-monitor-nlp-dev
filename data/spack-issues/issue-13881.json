    "body": "fixes #5613\r\nfixes #4212\r\nfixes #1090\r\nrefers to #13874 \r\n\r\nThis PR permits to list mirrors of the main `url` in packages. If the main `url` is not available the `url` in the mirrors will be tried in order. It also defines a `GNUMirrorPackage` mixin to deal with the special case of GNU packages and modifies all the GNU packages in the built-in repository.\r\n\r\nNote that the feature is implemented starting from 5b377a0 while previous commits are just trivial refactors that should reduce a bit the complexity of fetchers. If they are considered noise for a review I can split this PR into two.",
