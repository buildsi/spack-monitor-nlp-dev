    "body": "~~fixes #25612~~\r\n\r\nAfter having trouble to use MPI on two supercomputers with Spack (see #12520), I decided to look at the Spack source  code. The `module show` output is critically important to the use of external packages in modules. This pull request adds a subsection explaining how to handle\r\n* modules with dependencies on other modules,\r\n* modules where the prefix computation does not work, and\r\n* metamodules (i.e., modules that only load other modules).\r\n\r\nI want to thank the Spack team for the clean code base and spelling out function names. Within hours I had a rough grasp of how the prefix is computed inside the Spack code. (It could have been faster if I had read the [Developer Guide](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/developer_guide.html) but adding `print()` statements was more engaging.)",
