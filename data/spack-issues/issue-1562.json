    "body": "Fixes #1266, #1966.\n\nRebased #866 on `develop`.  See discussion there.\n\nTo recap, from @alalazo:\n##### Modifications\n- [x] removed global db locks from `install`, `uninstall` and `diy`\n- [x] added lock for stage directory (an exclusive lock is taken as part of the `Stage` context manager)\n- [x] added lock for prefix directory (an exclusive lock is taken during `Package.do_install`)\n- [x] debug output shows locks acquire and release\n- [x] Use single lock file instead of per-prefix locks.\n##### Install and uninstall are not mutually exclusive\n\nThis means that if : \n\n```\nspack uninstall ...\n```\n\nis run concurrently with \n\n```\nspack install ...\n```\n\nthe former command may cause the latter to fail (the same way an administrator can `sudo rm ...` something that another admin is about to use)\n",
