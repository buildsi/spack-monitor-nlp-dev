    "body": "Properties read from configuration and applied to specs may not be represented after af65146. This registers the special configuration types as represent-able in `syaml.dump`, thereby enabling core functions like `dag_hash` to proceed as normal for properties read from configuration.\r\n\r\nAt a lower level: syaml.dump now allows representing all syaml_ objects (in af65146 this was only available for syaml.dump_config).",
