    "body": "Spack by default chooses `1.0rc2` instead of `1.0` though `1.0` is a stable and newer release.  We manually mark the version `1.0` as preferred.\r\n\r\nNote that we want to avoid removing unstable versions (e.g., `rc2` ...) as suggested in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/15786#discussion_r401788921 since `margo` package points to an old unstable version. I have contacted one of maintainers but it would require more time. We believe these unstable versions can be removed in the next update. ",
