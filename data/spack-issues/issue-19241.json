    "body": "@AndrewGaspar I think this solves a problem you have.\r\n\r\nCurrently, when in an environment view, the python scripts are updated to point to the python in the view. This is done even when the python is external (and therefore not merged into the view).\r\n\r\nThe fix is simple: only do that relocation when the python is actually linked into the view (i.e. when it is not external).",
