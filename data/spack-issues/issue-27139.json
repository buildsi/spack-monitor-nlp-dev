    "body": "After #26608 I got a report about missing rpaths when building a downstream package independently using a spack-installed toolchain (@tmdelellis). This occurred because the spack-installed libraries were being linked into the downstream app, but the rpaths were not being manually added. Prior to #26608 autotools-installed libs would retain their hard-coded path and would thus propagate their link information into the downstream library on mac.\r\n\r\nWe could solve this problem *if* the mac linker (ld) respected `LD_RUN_PATH` like it does on GNU systems, i.e. adding `rpath` entries to each item in the environment variable. However on mac we would have to manually add rpaths either using spack's compiler wrapper scripts or manually (e.g. using `CMAKE_BUILD_RPATH` and pointing to the libraries of all the autotools-installed spack libraries).\r\n\r\nThe easier and safer thing to do for now is to simply stop changing the dylib IDs.\r\n",
