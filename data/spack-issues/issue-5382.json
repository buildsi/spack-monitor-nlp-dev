    "body": "+ The recipe for cgns seems to be wrong. CMake complains about variables set but not used (`HDF5_NEEDS_ZLIB`, `HDF5_NEEDS_MPI` and `HDF5_NEEDS_SZIP`) and fails to find HDF5.\r\n+ This change-set removes these variables from the cmake configure line, replacing them with `'-DHDF5_DIR=%s' % spec['hdf5'].prefix`\r\n+ cgns also has trouble with parallel make, so I set `parallel = False`.\r\n\r\n",
