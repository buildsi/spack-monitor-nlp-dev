    "body": "If you run `spack help`, you'll notice that the `test` subcommand is duplicated:\r\n```\r\n$ spack help\r\n...\r\n    stage           Expand downloaded archive in preparation for install\r\n    test            A thin wrapper around the pytest command.\r\n    test            A thin wrapper around the pytest command.\r\n    uninstall       Remove an installed package\r\n...\r\n```\r\nThis PR fixes that. I believe this line was leftover from when `spack test` actually _was_ a thin wrapper around `pytest`, but since then we've added a dedicated `cmd/test.py` module. @alalazo Can you confirm?",
