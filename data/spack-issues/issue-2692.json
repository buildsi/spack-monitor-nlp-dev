    "body": "@alalazo What do you think of a standard (multi-valued) variant called `build-type`, with the possible values `debug`, `release`, `relwithdebinfo` and `minsizerel`.  This could map directly to CMake's `CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE` variable, implemented in the `CMakePackage` superclass.\r\n\r\nThe idea is that `build-type` would not typically be set globally.  But if we think it were to be set globally, we should maybe call it `cmake-build-type`, so setting it doesn't confuse a similar build type for other build systems, but with different values.\r\n\r\n(@tgamblin We really need to get #2386 merged...)\r\n",
