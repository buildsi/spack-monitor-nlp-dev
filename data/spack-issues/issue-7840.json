    "body": "This is an update to the existing GlobalArrays package to support the current releases. This is likely a breaking change to existing users; however, the existing package would likely not work anymore anyway. It was based on patching a cmake build from the master branch of GA that was current in April 2017, but has changed significantly since then (i.e., the patch wouldn't work anymore).\r\n\r\nI contacted the previous developer @serbanmaerean and got permission to modify the existing package as needed. Serban is no longer using the existing GlobalArrays package.",
