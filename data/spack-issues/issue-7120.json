    "body": "Depends on #7115.\r\n\r\nSpack has relocatable binary packages, but we currently don't handle compiler runtime paths as well as we should.  Binary package should be aware of the compiler runtime paths from #7115 and should relocate them based on the installed compilers on a new machine.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Update the binary package support so that compiler runtime paths are added to Spack's binary format as needed relocations, and so that binaries have their RPATHs rewritten to point to the appropriate compiler runtime on installation.\r\n\r\n- [ ] Decide what to do if a compiler needed for a relocation isn't available when a package is installed.  If we need to reinstall it, reinstall it as a dependency of the installation.",
