    "body": "This PR changes the instructions in the template file for Spack-global licenses to:\r\n\r\n* work around #6534 (2018 versions of Intel installers do not tolerate leading comments in some cases),\r\n* leave the template *unchanged* if the system is already configured to use the license in question.\r\n\r\nRelated to #7469, but factored out for separate development and review.\r\n",
