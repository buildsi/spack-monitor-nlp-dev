    "body": "When attempting to use a single Spack instance to manage installs for multiple platforms, Spack currently runs into issues recognizing the install platforms for packages that were installed on a different platform than the current platform.  While this problem may not affect all multi-platform Spack instances, it seems to affect at least instances that have packages that span Linux platforms with different operating systems and/or system architectures.\r\n\r\nTo reproduce this issue, download the latest version of Spack and follow these steps:\r\n- While on platform 1, install any small test package (e.g. `zlib`).\r\n- While on platform 2, install the same package that was installed on platform 1.\r\n- While on platform 1, run the command `spack uninstall package arch=platform1`.\r\n\r\nThe result of running this on a multi-platform Spack that spans `redhat6` and `redhat7` packages is the following:\r\n```\r\n[xjrc@redhat7]$ ./bin/spack uninstall zlib arch=linux-redhat7-x86_64\r\n==> Error: zlib arch=linux-redhat7-x86_64 matches multiple packages:\r\n\r\n-- linux-None-x86_64 / gcc@4.7.2 --------------------------------\r\niwchpoy zlib@1.2.8%gcc\r\n\r\n-- linux-redhat7-x86_64 / gcc@4.9.3 -----------------------------\r\nq6kn3wz zlib@1.2.8%gcc\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe problem seems to stem from the fact that Spack identifies the non-current platform to be a `None` platform, which causes ambiguities when referring to packages that exist on both platforms.",
