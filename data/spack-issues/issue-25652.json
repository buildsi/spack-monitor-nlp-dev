    "body": "from rocm-4.3.0 onwards, we have a new binary executable amdclang/amdclang++/amdflang etc . Since these were in a same /bin folder as with clang/clang++/flang, it was required to create a new symlinks in a separate /bin folder and have it link to original executable. \r\nI have made the changes to add a prefix path /llvm and created /bin and llvm-alt in the install prefix path for llvm-amdgpu package. \r\nI have verified the rocm packages for 4.3.0 and 4.2.0 . I am currently seeing a build issue with rocblas because of which 6 other packages are not verified (hipblas,rocsolver,rocalution,migraphx,rocm-validation-suite,rocm-openmp-extras) All other packages were able to build successfully. \r\n\r\nAfter this change, we need to add a new optional variant for closed source binary (A+A ) and have it symlinked through llvm-alt.\r\n\r\n@arjun-raj-kuppala  and @haampie  , while trying to analyse the failure of rocblas, one thing that i noticed is in the cmakecache.txt for rocblas, for the CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH i did not see the path for prefix for llvm-amdgpu/llvm/lib .. Not sure if this is causing the failure. though i added rpath etc for llvm-amdgpu package, it did not help. \r\nI did try with few things but did not work so far. So, any inputs ",
