    "body": "I'd like to set a default path for named environments via a `config.yaml` setting, eg \r\n```\r\nconfig:\r\n  environments_root: $HOME/my_spack_environments\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nWe (NERSC) have a user-facing Spack install, whose site defaults set repos, install_tree etc in the user's $HOME area. We plan to encourage users to use Spack environments, but currently the default is for the environment to be created in the (global, read-only-for-users) Spack directory. If we could set a site default for where a user's named environments will be located, this makes the usage easier.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nThe ideal solution would be an additional configuration parameter as described above.\r\nThe alternative is to tell users to use `-d` every time, or not to use environments.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n<!--*Add any other context about the feature request here.*-->\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\nWe are using Spack version 0.14.2\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n\r\n\r\n<!--If you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack!\r\n-->",
