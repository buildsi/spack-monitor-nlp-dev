This PR is an attempt to use [this feature](https://help.github.com/articles/about-issue-and-pull-request-templates/) of Github to that aim.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nThe single issue template we had before has now been substituted by three more specialized templates, which account for:\r\n- Feature requests\r\n- Bug reports\r\n- Build errors\r\n\r\n*The idea* is, instead of categorizing issues ourselves, to let a contributor decide which kind of issue he's about to open and help him provide the maintainers with all the necessary information. *The hope* is that this will help categorizing and prioritizing reports.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nThere are a few things worth remarking:\r\n- The wording in the templates is tentative. Suggestions to improve it are welcome.\r\n- I was looking for ways to auto-label issues based on templates, but couldn't find any. Will investigate more and report back.\r\n\r\nIf you want to see the mechanism live, try open an issue repository in this [toy-repository](https://github.com/forthelols/ubimaior/issues) of mine.",
