    "body": "I just noticed this while trying to build the documentation on my laptop. Building the documentation requires the `dot` command, which comes from `graphviz`.\n\n```\nWARNING: dot command 'dot' cannot be run (needed for graphviz output), check the graphviz_dot setting\n```\n\nI tried installing it with pip, but the pip version doesn't supply the dot command. `dnf install graphviz` worked for me. I assume Spack's graphviz package provides the same dot command.\n\nBtw, is this something we should add to `.travis.yml`? It seems to be working atm...\n",
