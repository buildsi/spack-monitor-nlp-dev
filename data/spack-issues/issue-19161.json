    "body": "Hi Adam, \r\nThanks for your suggestion. \r\nI changed the develop to master in the script. \r\nIn addition, I forgot to change the hompage to the new one. So, I submitted a new pull request here.\r\nPlease ignore the previous request and approve this one. Thanks.\r\nFYI, I changed the archive to download version in spack package only from this version number (2.1.10). All the previous versions' checksums are unchanged.\r\n\r\nBest,\r\nSheng",
