    "body": "Closes #8119.\r\n\r\n`spack -V` previously always returned the version of spack from `spack.spack_version`.  This gives us a general idea of what version users are on, but if they're on `develop` or on some branch, we have to ask more questions.\r\n\r\nThis PR makes `spack -V` check whether this instance of Spack is a git repository, and if it is, it appends useful information from `git describe --tags` to the version.  Specifically, it adds:\r\n\r\n  - number of commits since the last release tag\r\n  - abbreviated (but unique) commit hash\r\n\r\nSo, if you're on `develop` you might get something like this:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack -V\r\n0.13.3-912-3519a1762\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis means you're on commit 3519a1762, which is 912 commits ahead of the 0.13.3 release.\r\n\r\nIf you are on a release branch, or if you are using a tarball of Spack,\r\nyou'll get the usual `spack.spack_version`:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack -V\r\n0.13.3\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis should help when asking users what version they are on, since a lot\r\nof people use the `develop` branch.",
