    "body": "I've added spack to repology (went live in the middle of today) and as part of that, I stumbled on this entire three page of \"spack problems\"\r\n\r\nhttps://repology.org/repository/spack/problems\r\n\r\nAnd of course could not simply leave them there, so I went through each one and fixed the package. There were a few that should be further discussed in #25490 but for the most part these are small changes to update urls to use https, or update the perl package manager, or replace urls that are now 404. For a few sites that triggered errors (that didn't have https) the certificate setup might be strange but it's not broken, so I didn't change those. It looks like from the file count I was able to fix 379/397, which is pretty good!\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
