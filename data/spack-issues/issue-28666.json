    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\n\n`spack install gcc`\r\n\r\nI see that the installed `gcc` contains the complete (?) gcc source tree in `share/src/gcc`. This consumes a lot of disk space and shouldn't be necessary for a tool like Spack. Spack collects enough metadata to ensure reproducibility without preserving the source three in a binary installation. Most other packages don't install their source tree.\r\n\r\n@alalazo  @michaelkuhn\n\n### Information on your system\n\n```\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-971-3cf5df7e3b\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.9\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-monterey-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n```\n\n### Additional information\n\nn/a\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
