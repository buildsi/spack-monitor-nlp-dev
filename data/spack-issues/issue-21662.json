For most packages, since `CC` was set correctly, nothing broke. But for packages using `Makefiles` that set `CC` based on `which clang`, it was using the system compilers instead of the compiler wrappers. Discovered when working on `py-xgboost@0.90`.\r\n\r\nAn alternative fix would be to copy the symlinks in `env/clang` to `env/apple-clang`. Let me know if you think there's a better way to do this, or to test this.",
