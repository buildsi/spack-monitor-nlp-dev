    "body": "This pull request contains 3 distinct updates:\r\n\r\n- Building the documentation requires libarchive, a dependency which was before not detected because the build I used relied on some cheats with the \"dirty\" flag, which is no longer present. The dependency is now correctly pulled in.\r\n- There are now 2 additional variants for building the HTML and the PDF documentation, with the defaults set to the defaults in the SWI prolog cmake file.\r\n- Version 8.2.0 was released in May, which is now also included in the package.",
