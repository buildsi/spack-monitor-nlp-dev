    "body": "I installed gcc 9.2.0 with spack and it added it as a compiler, but it found it in the wrong folder, making it unusable for subsequent builds. The compiler was installed in spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu16.04-broadwell/... but was found in spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu16.04-x86_64/...\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install gcc\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nUbuntu 16.04 using the default system compiler of gcc 5.4.0, when compiling there was a warning that the built in compiler didn't support the latest arch flags, so it was using broadwell instead.  Perhaps this was a missed corner case. \r\n\r\ntagging @becker33 \r\n",
