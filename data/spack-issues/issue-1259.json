    "body": "Previously, if you renamed a file using `git mv`, the run-flake8 test would get confused because you changed the old file, but the old file no longer exists by that name. Adding the `--find-renames` flag to `git diff` solves this and only lists the new file name. See #1171.\n\nThis PR also excludes homepage from the line length check. See #1230.\n",
