    "body": "I needed to make a few changes to the `openfoam-com` and `openfoam-org` packages to get them to build on the Cray platform with the system `cray-mpich` library.\r\n\r\nThe platform is detected as \"cray\", but it can be treated as \"linux64\".  Also fix a few typos with the ppc strings.\r\n\r\nThe MPI library needs to be linked with `-lmpich` instead of `-lmpi`.\r\n\r\nOpenFOAM has a weird `#include` of ptscotch inside an `extern \"C\"` block, which messes with the MPI C++ bindings.  `MPICH_IGNORE_CXX_SEEK` was already defined, but that's not good enough.  `MPICH_SKIP_MPICXX` works fine, though.",
