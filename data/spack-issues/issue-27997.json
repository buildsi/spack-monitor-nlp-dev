    "body": "Both [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and [Homebrew](https://formulae.brew.sh/formula/python@3.9) now default to Python 3.9, so Spack should follow suit.\r\n\r\nI also added Python 3.10 while I was at it. Confirmed that it builds successfully on macOS 10.15.7 with Apple Clang 12.0.0. I'm unable to test the Cray and Fujitsu patches.\r\n\r\nFixes #27921",
