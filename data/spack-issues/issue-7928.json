    "body": "When building eospac with `%clang`, spack's Fortran compiler wrapper is called 'flang', which is rejected by the eospac build system. Allow compilation with `%clang` by patching the eospac build system.\r\n\r\nMy testing only covers `%clang` where flang is actually gfortran.  However, this patch only registers 'flang' as a known Fortran compiler and does not set any flags or options that are compiler specific.",
