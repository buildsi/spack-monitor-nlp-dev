    "body": "refers #15246\r\n\r\nI could use some suggestions on dealing with the configure options. I can look at the arch and compiler from spack, and combine that with the variant from the user for serial, dmpar, etc. to come up with the numeric value for the configure script, but it seems the configure script changes as wrf versions update - so that seems kludgy. Any better ideas? \r\n\r\nAnyway, it does seem to build and install successfully.\r\n\r\nI plan to follow up with some of the post-processing tools, etc. ",
