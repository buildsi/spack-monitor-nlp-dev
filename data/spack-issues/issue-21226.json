    "body": "    The assimp variant up to now is buggy - the subpackage that uses assimp is not\r\n    actually enabled by the DD4HEP_LOAD_ASSIMP flag as the recipe assumes, it will\r\n    enable automatically if it finds the assimp::assimp target (the flag instead\r\n    will trigger an on-the-fly build). This commit fixes this by disabling the flag.\r\n    The assimp dependency is updated to the not-yet-released version 5.0.2, as it\r\n    actually needs the current master or newer, otherwise there is a cmake failure.\r\n\r\nTo get a working version of assimp, I also add the master branch.",
