    "body": "The name of the debug log written by the cc compiler wrapper is given by `Spec.short_spec`, which includes the architecture. Somewhere along the line `Spec.format` started adding spaces around the architecture property so the filename started including spaces; the cc wrapper script appears to ignore this, so files like `spack-cc-bzip2-....in.log` (which record the wrapped compiler invocations) were not being generated. ~This updates the value of `SPACK_SHORT_SPEC` to a value without spaces (just includes the name and hash).~\r\n\r\nEDIT: the original value of `SPACK_SHORT_SPEC` was important so I added a new variable to store the identifier used to generate log file names (`SPACK_DEBUG_LOG_ID`).",
