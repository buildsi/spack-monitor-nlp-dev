    "body": "I'm trying to build Wine with spack.\r\n\r\nWine's build system attempts to link `[full spack staging path]/loader/l_intl.nls` to `loader/l_intl.nls`; unfortunately they're the same file. `configure` notices that it can't access the file anymore, so that step fails the build.\r\n\r\nDoing `build_directory = 'build'` fixes this, (and I think deleting `WINE_CONFIG_SYMLINK(loader,loader,[l_intl.nls])` then re-running `autoreconf` does too but that might break other things).\r\n\r\nHas anyone seen anything like this before? Is changing the build directory the usual solution for this, if so?",
