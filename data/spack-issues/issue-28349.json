    "body": "Sarus is an OCI-compliant container engine for HPC systems.\r\n\r\nThe post-install step requires root privileges. The package issues a warning at the end of spack's installation with the necessary steps to complete the configuration (similar to var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/singularityce/package.py)\r\n\r\ntini is a tiny init for containers. It is a dependency of Sarus.\r\n\r\nAs an alternative to the post-installation message, I was trying to call sudo from within Sarus's package.py on the script mentioned in the post-installation message so as to avoid the chance of a user missing the message. The command ran fine but it didn't accept valid password entries. That is perhaps because spack is processing the input before is handed over to sudo?",
