    "body": "This patch is intended to build MFEM with LLVM's libunwind if the spec contains `+libunwind%clang`; however, I can't find a succinct way of doing that here. Lines 204-206 are supposed to enumerate all compilers other than clang, but I'm sure I'm missing XL, and possibly other compilers; this partial fix is temporary, mainly to PR a patch that almost does what it's supposed to. I'm also pretty sure I need to add a `-g` flag to the compiler commands for `mfem+libunwind%clang`; for now, I've built locally with `mfem+debug+libunwind%clang` because I need the debug info anyway, and I think bigger issues with this PR need to be addressed first, before adding flags.\r\n\r\nA related PR is #7263; also see the comment at https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/7263#issuecomment-367258043. I don't think forcing users to add an external `libunwind` using system paths will be any easier, because:\r\n\r\n- LLVM's libunwind is definitely different than the https://savannah.nongnu.org/projects/libunwind/ version of libunwind currently built by spack's libunwind package. Although they have a common ABI and some functions that form a common API (see http://lists.llvm.org/pipermail/cfe-dev/2016-September/050649.html), the libraries provide different symbols and the non-GNU version has more features\r\n\r\n- The path of the LLVM libunwind header looks like `${LLVM_PREFIX}/lib/clang/${VERSION}/include/unwind.h` (e.g., `/usr/local/opt/llvm/lib/clang/6.0.0/include/unwind.h`), so listing a prefix isn't necessarily helpful for non-Apple LLVM installs. Apple installs have a simpler path (`/usr/include/unwind.h`), and libraries for Apple and non-Apple LLVM installs are in the usual directory (i.e., `$PREFIX/lib`)\r\n\r\n- If a user installs LLVM via spack, they might want to use the accompanying libunwind, but it's not clear to me how to encode that information in a `packages.yaml` programmatically; maybe it's worth putting a `provides('llvm-libunwind')` directive in the LLVM spack package\r\n\r\nSuggestions to make adding this feature more workable are welcome; I will do what I can to address them.",
