    "body": "### Problem:\r\nEach version of `py-protobuf` depends on the exact same version of `protobuf`. Tracking this kind of dependency is only possible with a lot of boilerplate, which we aim to avoid.\r\n\r\n### Solution:\r\n* Add `same_version_as`-directive that automatically adds a one-to-one dependency of each version of the package to the exact same version of the other package.\r\n\r\n* Use `same_version_as`-directive to keep versions of py-protobuf and protobuf in sync (i.e., `py-protobuf@2.6.1` depends on `protobuf@2.6.1`, `py-protobuf@.3.7.1` depends on `protobuf@3.7.1` and so forth).\r\n\r\n* Add mock packages used in tests to ensure `same_version_as`-directive remains functional.",
