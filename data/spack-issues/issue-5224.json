It complains if you run on any other family. \"ERROR: Target architecture mismatch. Please delete or regenerate sys.{so,dll,dylib}.\" I have compiled on our oldest family (Nahalem). Based on my experience with compiling R on my cluster (non-Spack) by compiling on the oldest family, it will run everywhere. This was not the case with the Julia package.",
