    "body": "Although ABI-compatible, Cray's mpich might be slightly different from default mpich, so it makes sense to split up the package into `cray-mpich` and `mpich`.\r\n\r\nIn particular version numbers of cray-mpich differ from mpich, and having those Cray version numbers makes it easier to add constraints.\r\n\r\nOn my cluster I could only find a single version of cray-mpich, so the `version` list is a bit sparse now, hopefully people can add some versions they find on their systems.",
