    "body": "Fixes #2586.\r\n\r\nHDF5 `1.8.14` and below have a weird `libtool` issue on Ubuntu where the postdeps in the generated `libtool` script end up with arg-less `-l`s.  This results in this error from #2586:\r\n\r\n> FCLD libhdf5_fortran.la\r\n> /usr/bin/ld: cannot find -l-L/nfs/software/linux-ubuntu_trusty_amd64/apps/packages/gcc/gcc-6.2.0/bin/../lib/gcc/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu/6.2.0\r\n> collect2: error: ld returned 1 exit status\r\n\r\nThis happens whether you build HDF5 inside or outside of Spack, and running `libtoolize` and `autoreconf -if` don't seem to fix it.  It's fixed in HDF5 `1.10` and later versions of `1.8`.\r\n\r\nThis adds a post-configure step to remove the spurious `-l`s from the `libtool` script, which makes `1.8.12`-`1.8.14` build correctly.",
