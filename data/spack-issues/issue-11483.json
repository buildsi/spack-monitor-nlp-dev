    "body": "We've gotten a lot of complaints about CMake taking a long time to build, and I'd like to change the default to `+ownlibs` to reduce that overhead. \r\n\r\n- CMake is built *very* frequently, and the number of dependencies it has accumulated can take a very long time on some systems.\r\n\r\n- Use +ownlibs by default to avoid the build overhead. This won't interfere with other packages by introducing conflicting libraries, as CMake is nearly always a build dependency.",
