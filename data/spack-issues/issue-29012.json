    "body": "### Summary\n\nCurrently `spack buildcache create` only has an option to choose between\r\n- caching the package and its link/run dependencies ;\r\n- caching the package only ;\r\n- caching the link/run dependencies only.\r\nNo option to cache the build dependencies as well.\r\n\r\nIt would be nice to be able to cache all dependencies, including the build ones.\n\n### Rationale\n\nWhen installing a spec with `spack install <spec>` without `--cache-only`, spack indeed does not find out if every required run/link deps are in cache. Thus is fetches build dependencies (see issue  #12294).\r\n\r\nFor such case, it would be nice to be able to easily cache all dependencies, including build deps.\r\n\r\nNB: I did not succeed in using `spack buildcache install <spec>` where spec includes `target=x86_64 os=debian11` (which is not the default arch from the buildcache perspective, albeit it is for spack, as configured in `etc/spack/packages.yaml`)\n\n### Description\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\nUsing the develop branch.\r\n```\r\n$ spack --version\r\n0.17.1-1227-3c1b2c0fc9\r\n```\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
