Checks for deprecated specs (introduced in #12933) were repeatedly taking out read locks on the database, which can be very slow.\r\n2. `get_platform()` is pretty expensive and can be called many times in a spack invocation.\r\n\r\n- [x] put a read transaction around the deprecation check to avoid repeated locking/reading\r\n- [x] memoize `get_platform()`\r\n\r\n@ajw1980 @matz-e: does this improve things for you?",
