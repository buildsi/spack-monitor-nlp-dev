    "body": "Note this is not really a bug but more of a suggested improvement to the Open MPI spack package.   There were issues in the 3.0 and 3.1 release streams where setting ```--disable-builtin-atomics``` was suggested for working around problems found in the Open MPI shared memory device.  This problem should be resolved in newer releases.  This should be reflected in the Open MPI spack package default for enabling/disabling builtin atomics.",
