    "body": "After the renaming in #13411 using a previously installed environment doesn't work anymore, and I get `py-jupyter-notebook not found`. I think that is to be expected, however the fix requires a manual removal of `spack.lock` and a fixup in `spack.yaml`. At least the first one spack should be able to handle on its own and it should help me find the error in my environment specification\r\n\r\n```\r\n# anything before 13411\r\n% spack create general\r\n% spack add py-jupyter-notebook\r\n% spack install\r\n# update to after 13411\r\n% spack env activate general\r\n==> Error: Package 'py-jupyter-notebook' not found.\r\n```",
