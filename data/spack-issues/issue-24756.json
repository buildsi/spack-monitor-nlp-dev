    "body": "Navigate to your packages source directory and execute `spack develop -p . SPEC` writes a literal `.` to the `develop:PACKAGE:path` field in the Spack environment.  Later, when running `spack install`, the build will fail because`.` is not expanded and will take the value of whatever is the current directory when you run `spack install`.  When writing the `develop` field to an environment when a user explicitly specifies the `-p` argument, the argument should be expanded so that `spack install` will work when the user changes directories.",
