    "body": "Installing macOS buildcaches on a linux host does not work by design because otool and install_name_tool are not available. Although the sources for these two tools could be founs and built as packages, it would be faster to use two python packages that are already available in spack: py-machotools and py-macholib\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nHEP software is distributed by CVMFS. The CVMFS server is running SL6, but macOS buildcaches need to be installed.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nChange the relocation of macOS binaries to use the python tools instead of the command line tools otool and install_name_tool.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n",
