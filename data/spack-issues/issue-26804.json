    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI have an environment containing ~40 explicitly declared packages, including some with moderately deep dependency chains, e.g. `py-itk` and `py-pandas`.  The generated `loads` file contains ~1250 packages and takes more than 15 minutes to source.  However, if I convert it to a single module file via `cat /path/to/loads | grep 'module load' | awk -F\" \" '{ printf \"depends_on(\\\"%s\\\")\\n\", $3 }'`, `lmod` loads in only 3s.  It appears that the separate calls to `module load` in the `loads` file incur a superlinear slowdown over use of `module load` and `depends_on` directly.\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\n_No response_\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.3-4878-4acda0839b\r\n* **Python:** 3.9.6\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
