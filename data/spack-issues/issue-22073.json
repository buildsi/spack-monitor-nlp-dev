    "body": "I have two questions regarding this PR.\r\n\r\nNewer versions of SCR now *require* DTCMP as a dependency rather than allowing it as an option.  It would be nice to disable the ``+dtcmp`` variant for those later SCR versions, but I don't see a way to do that.\r\n\r\nIs there a way?\r\n\r\nI did find this related issue:\r\nhttps://github.com/spack/spack/issues/9740\r\n\r\nAlso, I'd like to change a particular directory from ``/tmp`` to ``/dev/shm``.  While this is a better choice on Linux systems, ``/dev/shm`` does not exist on other platforms like macOS.  It'd be nice to use ``/dev/shm`` on Linux but keep ``/tmp`` on other platforms.\r\n\r\nIs there a recommended way to set the variant default based on the target platform?\r\n\r\nThanks for any help!",
