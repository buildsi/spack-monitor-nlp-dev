    "body": "Fixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/12612\r\n\r\n@glennpj can you confirm this fix?\r\n\r\nWhen Spack installs a package it writes the `package.py` file and patches to a separate repository (which reflects the state of the package at the time it was installed). Previously, Spack only wrote patches that were used at installation time. This updates the archiving step to include all patch files that are relevant to the package (in case that repository is used in another context).\r\n\r\n",
