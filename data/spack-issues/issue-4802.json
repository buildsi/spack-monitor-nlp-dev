In later PRs we could add:\r\n\r\n1. support for other optional features\r\n2. make `mpi` implementations dependent on `slurm` where appropriate\r\n\r\n2 in particular allows for encoding the information on which `slurm` has been used to compile e.g. `mvapich2`. This will be useful in a scenario where `slurm` is an external package, and is upgraded at different times for nodes that otherwise share the same architecture (os + platform + target).",
