This broke some packages which depended on the old behavior of `.headers.directories`: for example if you had `<package-prefix>/include/subdir/ex1.h`, `.headers.directories` would include `<package-prefix>/include/subdir`.\r\n\r\nThis updates the `.headers` property to include subdirectories for Python and Eigen (as is recommended by these packages).\r\n\r\nIn hindsight, it was a mistake not to request documentation on https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/10623. So that should be added here or soon.",
