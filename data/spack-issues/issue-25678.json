    "body": "This PR adds a `__reduce__` method to `spack.environment.Environment`. Without this, we hit the maximum recursion limit when trying to pickle `Environment` objects.\r\n\r\nFixes #20025. This PR is very similar in spirit to #25658, which fixed #23892.\r\n\r\nThis PR was just the bare minimum needed to fix the issue. I have no idea if I implemented `__reduce__` correctly or not...\r\n\r\nAlso, I would really like to avoid catching `BaseException` in `spack.install_test.TestSuite.__call__` so that this kind of issue would be easier to diagnose in the future. On develop, `spack test run` doesn't raise any exception and silently doesn't do anything.",
