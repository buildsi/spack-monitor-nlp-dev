    "body": "If allspack configs are defined within `spack.yaml`, a dynamic pipeline executes correctly. However, when the `spack.yaml` includes include paths, the CI jobs which result do not copy the includes into the scratch dir before attempting to activate the environment, resulting in an error.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1. Create a spack environment that has include files\r\n2. Run `spack ci generate`\r\n3. push to gitlab CI runner\r\n4. Observe error message from child jobs.\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\n\r\n```console\r\n==> Error: Detected 4 missing include path(s):\r\n<project home>/jobs_scratch_dir/common/repos.yaml\r\n<project home>/jobs_scratch_dir/common/modules.yaml\r\n<project home>/jobs_scratch_dir/common/mirrors.yaml\r\n<project home>/jobs_scratch_dir/common/config.yaml\r\n```\r\n\r\n",
