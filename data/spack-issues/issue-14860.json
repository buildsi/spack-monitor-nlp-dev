    "body": "Fixes #14850.  Commit 6b1958219 added versions 2020 and 2020.1 for\r\nintel-tbb as part of updating several intel packages but added the\r\nwrong sha256 sums for the github/01org repository.\r\n\r\nAlso, version 2020 is 2020, not 2020.0.\r\n\r\nAdd patch makefile-debug to restore the debug targets.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nPlease double check my sha256 sums.  Just a simple wget for 2020 and\r\n2020.1 to make sure these are the right sha256 sums for the\r\ngithub/01org repo.\r\n\r\n@robert-mijakovic Where did you get the sha256 sums?  Were they from a\r\nprofessional version of TBB or something?  Anyway, I think these are\r\ncorrect for github/01org.\r\n",
