    "body": "Closes #16655 \r\nFixes #16581\r\n\r\n@t-karatsu @skosukhin can you test this? I think this should fix everyone's problems. Of course, this PR certainly doesn't preclude #16527, but it's easier to test and affects fewer packages, so we can get it merged more quickly.\r\n\r\nI tested with and without `+libyaml` on macOS 10.15.4 with Python 3.7.7 and Clang 11.0.3 and this PR works fine for me. Would love to have tests on other systems with other compilers.\r\n\r\nP.S. Sorry #16301 broke this package for all of you. In reality, the package was broken to begin with, but previously it failed silently and after #16301 it failed completely. I've added myself as a maintainer so hopefully this doesn't happen again.",
