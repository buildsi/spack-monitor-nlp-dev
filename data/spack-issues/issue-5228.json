    "body": "I'm not yet 100% certain, but I think I just ran into a spurious cache issue. \r\n\r\nThe problem were dependencies on ```java@8:``` which lead to a ```Multiple providers found``` error, caused by the introduction of ```icedtea``` in #4804. Adding the entry ```java: [jdk]``` into the providers section of ```etc/spack/packages.yaml``` didn't help and commenting out the ```provides('java')``` line in ```icedtea``` lead to ```Package not found: java```.\r\n\r\nI believe this is due to: \r\n1) Me not realizing that there are now multiple ```java```-providers and ```spack``` not automatically choosing a default\r\n2) ```spack``` not automatically updating its caches if setting-files have changed\r\n3) dependency resolving seems to depend on whether there are multiple providers of a given ?name?\r\n\r\nFirst of all: Does my explanation make sense? Or am I missing something?\r\n\r\nTo 1) is this intentional? Or should there be always a default provider (if a new package gets added the old one takes precedence?)\r\nTo 2) is there a way to get ```spack```'s currently used settings? I.e. a complete current dictionary the is the union of all used ```*.yaml``` files, ideally with markings where which entry originates.\r\n2b) how hard would it be for spack to validate its caches? \r\n\r\nAs always thanks for any feedback/pointers",
