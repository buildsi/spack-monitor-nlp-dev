    "body": "If I create a new `spack.yaml` in a folder and concretize it, Spack writes default values into it unexpectedly. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\nUse this simple `spack.yaml`:\r\n```yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  packages:\r\n    mpi:\r\n      buildable: False        \r\n  specs:\r\n  - openjpeg\r\n```\r\nIf we concretize it we can notice that the `spack.yaml` changed on disk:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --env . concretize\r\n$ cat spack.yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  packages:\r\n    mpi:\r\n      buildable: false\r\n      version: []\r\n      target: []\r\n      compiler: []\r\n      providers: {}\r\n  specs:\r\n  - openjpeg\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Error Message\r\nNo error message, but a regression on #12313 which was solved by #13546. The `spack.yaml` file is rewritten only if **nested** attributes are missing defaults i.e. this does not occur if any attribute directly under `spack` is not specified.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-803-370163393\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.9\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu18.04-broadwell\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n",
