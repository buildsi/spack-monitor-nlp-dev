    "body": "Hi\r\n\r\nI want to write a python script that detects CPU target then will pass that onto `spack load.`\r\n\r\nSo `spack load r` would become `spack load r target=sandybridge.`\r\n\r\nWe have a heterogeneous environment so this would be helpful to add in Slurm submission scripts.\r\n\r\nCan someone point me to the Spack functions that detect CPU architecture?",
