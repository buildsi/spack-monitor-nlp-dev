    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nRight now `spack find` command seems only picking up the configurations with highest priority when existed. That means if a user defines a different directory of `.spack-db` in the user level `config.yaml`, he/she can only query the packages installed in that user-level directory and miss the ones installed in site or default level directories. \r\n\r\nPlease let me know if my understand is wrong or there is some other way to query across different scopes. If not available yet, I think it would be a good feature to add. \r\n\r\nThanks.",
