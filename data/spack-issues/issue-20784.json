    "body": "Ping @dev-zero. Currently on develop there's a problem with the new concretizer and dbcsr:\r\n\r\n```bash\r\n$ spack solve dbcsr\r\n==> Error: invalid values for variant \"cuda_arch\" in package \"dbcsr\": ['10']\r\n```\r\n\r\nI've tracked it down to 1343a815c02421fb94ddb2b80af76d35760bf4c4, and the advise was to no redefine `cuda_arch` and instead use conflicts, so that the conflicts regarding `cuda_arch=10` in the parent class `CudaPackage` would still make sense.\r\n",
