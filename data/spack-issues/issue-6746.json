    "body": "EDIT: I think I figure out the installation. \r\n\r\nOverriding `uninstall` is still tricky as I can't get to `octave` executable the same way I did with `install`:\r\n```\r\n    def do_uninstall(self, force=False):\r\n        \"\"\"Uninstall this package by spec.\"\"\"\r\n        name = 'spline'\r\n        inspect.getmodule(self).octave('pkg uninstall %s' % name)\r\n        # delegate to instance-less method.\r\n        Package.uninstall_by_spec(self.spec, force)\r\n```\r\nproduces\r\n```\r\n==> Error: 'module' object has no attribute 'octave'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI guess I leave this for another time unless someone knows an easy fix.\r\n\r\n----\r\n\r\n~~it's WIP as I am bit confused why `setup_dependent_package()` is not called, defined in `octave` package~~ https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/octave/package.py#L234-L241\r\n\r\nMaybe I just need to follow `PythonPackage` which has\r\n```\r\nimport inspect\r\ndef python(self, *args, **kwargs):\r\n        inspect.getmodule(self).python(*args, **kwargs)\r\n```\r\nand if I understand correctly is being used as `self.python`.\r\n\r\n",
