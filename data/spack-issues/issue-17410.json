    "body": "@adamjstewart , Made changes as per your review comments -\r\nTo your questions => Will other versions of PyTorch build with ROCM, or do we need to backport this patch to older releases to get that working?\r\nWhen i did a spack install py-torch +rocm -cuda -cudnn -nccl  , the build failed. On looking further i found there was a commit that recently went to fix. Hence i took the fix and applied the patch.\r\n\r\nI also tested the build for spack install py-torch@master +cuda +cudnn +nccl cuda_arch=70 ; spack install py-torch +cuda +cudnn +nccl cuda_arch=70.\r\n",
