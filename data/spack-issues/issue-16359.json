    "body": "This pull request makes the following changes to the `ffmpeg` package:\r\n\r\n- Adds older versions (i.e. the latest versions of `@1` and `@2`, `@1.0.10` and `@2.8.15`) to enable building older dependents (see `openscenegraph@3.4.0` for details).\r\n- Adds the `+avresample` variant, which allows for conditional building of the `libavresample` component (see `openscenegraph+ffmpeg` for details).\r\n- Overhauls variant handling in order to more accurately constrain variants to their supported versions (e.g. if `+variant` is only available in `@X.Y.Z:`, then a `@conflicts('@:X.Y-1.999', '+variant')` statement is added, etc.).\r\n- Changes package-based variant defaults to `False` for variants that aren't supported by all `ffmpeg` versions (e.g. `+sdl2`, `+lzma`).\r\n\r\nI've verified that the following variants of this package build with `gcc@4.9.3` on architecture `linux-rhel7-broadwell`:\r\n\r\n- `ffmpeg@1.0.10{+|~}avresample`\r\n- `ffmpeg@2.8.15{+|~}avresample`\r\n- `ffmpeg@4.2.2{+|~}avresample`\r\n\r\nLooking at the logs for these builds, I'm fairly confident the per-package variants that were changed will work in enabled states as well as their default disabled states (e.g. `+sdl2`, `+lzma`), but I've not tested these variants as there are quite a few. If there are any important ones I should double check, please let me know and I'll run builds on that subset.\r\n\r\nAlso, tagging @glennpj as he seems to be the most recent contributor to this package; please let me know if anything looks amiss relative to your changes!",
