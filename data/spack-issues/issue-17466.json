    "body": "The current version of `package.py` for `llvm-flang` executes `cmake(*args)` always as part of the post install.  If nVidia device offload is not part of the build, this results in referencing `args` without it being set and the error:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Error: UnboundLocalError: local variable 'args' referenced before assignment\r\n```\r\n\r\nLooking at previous version of `package.py` (https://github.com/owainkenwayucl/spack/blob/d1c708bdf3d95b63a8aaaac66a9434222d77b4ce/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/llvm-flang/package.py) this whole routine appears to be only required for offload, so indent `cmake/make/install` to be under the `if` and only executed if part of an offload nvptx build.",
