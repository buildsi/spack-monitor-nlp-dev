    "body": "Currently, if a build of a package with non-default variants is available, spack will not use it when building a package which has a compatible depends_on spec. Instead, it will do a build of the default variant of the dependency, unless explicitly asked to do otherwise in the \"spack install\" spec.\r\n\r\nI think that spack should look for installed packages with a spec matching a depends_on() statement before resorting to building a new version of the dependency.",
