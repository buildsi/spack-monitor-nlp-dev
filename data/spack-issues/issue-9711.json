    "body": "@becker33 \r\n\r\nThis creates a new repository for package installations which are used in https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial_advanced_packaging.html. It is placed alongside builtin, and disabled by default (you must do `spack repo add --scope=defaults var/spack/repos/tutorial` to enable it).\r\n\r\nThoughts so far on this approach:\r\n\r\n* I haven't checked this with the intended docker image (Ubuntu 18.04) but I have completed the advanced packaging tutorial with this on a different system (I intend to test with the target OS by the end of 11/5)\r\n* users will want to do this in a separate Spack repo clone if they aren't using the tutorial docker image, and will also want to be careful when adding the repo (the updated docs suggest using `--scope=defaults` to avoid modifying config under `~`).\r\n* users may get confused jumping into `var/spack/repos/tutorial` vs. `var/spack/repos/builtin` to edit packages\r\n* one advantage of having a separate branch vs. a separate Spack repo is that this branch could include a commit which fills in all the blanks",
