    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nThis issue continued  this one #21763) which want to set additionnal path for a Paraview plugin project.\r\n \r\nI have a project which is a paraview plugin and i need to set the PV_PLUGIN_PATH variable to make it available in paraview.\r\n\r\nTo detect my project as a plugin, Paraview need the full path to spack/opt/.../project/lib( or lib64)/paraview-<version of paraview>/plugin/project.\r\n\r\nAs when i install my plugin I did not know which is the paraview version associated, I need to make this path generic.\r\nTo this end I try to add in my recipe\r\n\r\n    def setup_run_environment(self, env):\r\n        env.prepend_path('PV_PLUGIN_PATH', join_path(self.prefix, 'lib*', '**', 'plugins','project'))\r\n\r\nHowever, the regular expression usage is not detected when i run paraview which say to me \"searching plugins in spack/opt/.../project/lib*/**/plugin/project.\".\r\nWhen i try to echo this path it works fine:\r\n\r\n> echo $PV_PLUGIN_PATH\r\n> spack/opt/.../project/lib64/paraview-5.9/plugin/project.\r\n\r\nIn short, I need to evaluate this regular expression during the module generation, and if possible in the setup_run_environment method. Is it possible ?\r\n\r\nThanks\r\nElo\u00efse",
