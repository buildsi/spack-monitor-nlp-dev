    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nThere is nothing to reproduce here, this is just pointing out there is at least one way (and likely others) that the binary index cache defined in `lib/spack/spack/binary_distribution.py` may become out of date with the binary packages actually present on remote mirrors.\r\n\r\nThis came up in review of #28504 in this [comment](https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/28504/files#r813878754).\r\n\r\nOne way that the local cache can be out of date is if buildcaches are removed from the mirror manually after the mirror index has been generated with `spack buildcache update-index ...` and then locally cached with `spack buildcache list ...`.  \r\n\r\nI'm not aware of any current code path in spack that is affected by the possibility of the local index cache becoming out of sync, but if we encounter any, let's add a note about it here and/or link the issue to this one.\r\n\r\nAddressing this issue could be part of a larger effort to rethink and refactor how binary index cache in spack works in general.\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\nThere is no error message for this issue at the moment.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis issue affects all os/platform/arch combinations.\r\n",
