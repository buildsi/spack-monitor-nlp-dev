    "body": "Hi all,\r\nI am trying to install Trilinos with intel 15.0.3 compiler but it fails with the error\r\n\r\n    amesos/src/Amesos_Superludist.cpp(490): error: identifier \"DOUBLE\" is undefined\r\n          DOUBLE\r\n          ^\r\n    \r\n    amesos/src/Amesos_Superludist.cpp(499): error: identifier \"EXTRA\" is undefined\r\n          EXTRA\r\n          ^\r\n\r\nI found [this git issue](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/issues/195) which says something about the same issue. Is there an easy fix for this?\r\n\r\nNote 1: I use a preinstalled compiler and `openmpi` in a cluster setting. This can't be changed since both `intel` compiler and `openmpi` have specially compiled for this cluster.\r\n\r\nNote 2: installing `Lua` with intel compiler fails, I fixed the issue by installing `Lua` using `gcc` and setting it as default in `packages.yaml`",
