It's certainly possible these compilers were removed manually. I tried looking for release notes from Cray that show this change, but couldn't find anything.\r\n\r\nAn idea I have would be to make sure that `self.prefix.bin/mpicc` exists, and otherwise fallback to `spack_*`.\n\n### Error message\n\nThere error is:\r\n\r\n```\r\nmpicc No such file or directory\r\n```\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-6557-4ab0d02aa8\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.6\r\n* **Platform:** cray-sles15-zen2\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
