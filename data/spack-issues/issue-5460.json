    "body": "closes #5201\r\n\r\nCurrently, if a user sets an external package to have a prefix that is one of the system paths (like `/usr`) the module files that are generated will prepend `/usr/bin` to `PATH`, etc. This is particularly nasty at the time when a module file is unloaded, and e.g. paths like `/usr/bin` will be discarded from `PATH`.\r\n\r\nThis PR solves the issue skipping system paths when a prefix inspection is made to generate module files.",
