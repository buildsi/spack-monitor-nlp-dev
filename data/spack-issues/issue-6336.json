    "body": "This adds the `5.0` version from the openfoam.org releases into spack. While I was at it I noticed that the checksum for the `4.1` was wrong so I fixed that as well. \r\n\r\nWith respect to the patches that were affecting the `4.1` version:\r\n- the `etc/bashrc` patch was not needed (IMHO) as the relevant section has been changed upstream (on the openfoam side of things). \r\n- the `etc/config.{c}sh/settings` patch has been added for version `5.0` in accordance to the previous version (`4.1`) patch so as not to include central (target) places for variables that intend to be user dependent. \r\n",
