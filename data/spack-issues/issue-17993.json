    "body": "The online documentation:\r\nhttps://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/environments.html\r\nin the section \"Included configurations\"\r\nstates\r\n\"Included configs listed later will have higher precedence, as the included configs are applied in order.\"\r\n\r\nThis does not match what I see when using included configurations.\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n1) Clone a new spack instance, copy yaml configs from etc/spack/defaults to etc/spack, and create a compilers.yaml with system compiler\r\n\r\n2) spack env create test\r\n\r\n3) Edit the spack.yaml for test env to be\r\n```yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  specs: []\r\n  view: true\r\n  include:\r\n    - /homes/payerle/spacktest/A/test.yaml\r\n    - /homes/payerle/spacktest/B/testb.yaml\r\n```\r\n4) Create the /homes/payerle/spacktest/A/test.yaml\r\nwith contents:\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  libiconv:\r\n    version: [1.15]\r\n```\r\n5) Create the /homes/payerle/spacktest/B/testb.yaml\r\nwith contents:\r\n```yaml\r\npackages:\r\n  libiconv:\r\n    version: [0.14]\r\n```\r\n6) Run a spec command for libiconv using the test environment:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack --debug --env test spec libiconv\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.487271] Imported spec from built-in commands\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.487841] Imported spec from built-in commands\r\nInput spec\r\n--------------------------------\r\nlibiconv\r\n\r\nConcretized\r\n--------------------------------\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.489582] Reading config file /homes/payerle/spacktest/B/testb.yaml\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.493707] Reading config file /homes/payerle/spacktest/A/test.yaml\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.496421] Reading config file /export/data/localhome/home/payerle/git/spack.test/var/spack/environments/test/spack.yaml\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.498496] Reading config file /export/data/localhome/home/payerle/git/spack.test/etc/spack/defaults/repos.yaml\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.499822] Reading config file /export/data/localhome/home/payerle/git/spack.test/etc/spack/repos.yaml\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.529911] Reading config file /export/data/localhome/home/payerle/git/spack.test/etc/spack/defaults/packages.yaml\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.546539] Reading config file /export/data/localhome/home/payerle/git/spack.test/etc/spack/packages.yaml\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.563246] Reading config file /export/data/localhome/home/payerle/git/spack.test/etc/spack/compilers.yaml\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.568517] Reading config file /homes/payerle/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.579323] '/usr/bin/gcc' '-dumpversion'\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.582085] '/usr/bin/gcc' '-dumpversion'\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.584372] '/usr/bin/gcc' '-dumpversion'\r\n==> [2020-08-11-12:12:40.586276] Warning: gcc@rh7-4.8.5 cannot build optimized binaries for \"skylake\".
