    "body": "I think I understand why spack wants all the package dirs to be all lower case and no funny chars. Thats fine. Though the python code then uses uppercase for the first letter in the class name to define the package.\r\n\r\nI would like to suggest something like `logoname` which may be optionally included with a package next to `url` and `homepage` that holds the case-senstive (and perhaps funny chars included) package name so that I can do something like...\r\n\r\n```\r\n    logoname=\"AMReX\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAnd then `spack info` would produce...\r\n\r\n```\r\nCMakePackage:    AMReX (amrex)\r\nHomepage:        https://ccse.lbl.gov/AMReX/index.html\r\n.\r\n.\r\n.\r\n```",
