    "body": "This is a general question that confuse me:\r\n\r\nI have only one compiler, gcc 4.4.6 installed,  I would like to install a package, let's call it P\r\n\r\nWhy `spack install P%gcc@4.4` and `spack install P%gcc@4.4.6` install the same package twice at two different locations, using the same compiler?\r\n\r\nWhat is the purpose of this behavior? I expect spack automatically complete the compiler version if it is unique or report if it is ambiguous. ",
