We should probably follow [homebrew](https://github.com/Homebrew/homebrew-core/blob/master/Formula/gcc.rb)s approach, where they apply this [patch](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/formula-patches/b8b8e65e/gcc/9.2.0-catalina.patch). However I'm not sure whether the bugzilla report should be taken as an indication that upstream gcc will fix things...",
