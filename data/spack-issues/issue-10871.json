    "body": "**snl-atdm-issue**\r\n\r\nFYI for Spack people ...\r\n\r\nWe just discovered that CUDA programs built with Kokkos with NVIDIA nvcc with Relocatable Device Code (RDC) enabled require all static libs (see [Trilinos GitHub #4502](https://github.com/trilinos/Trilinos/issues/4502)).  Therefore, if all Spack packages used in a CUDA build don't support a clean static build, that means no CUDA code with RDC can be enabled.\r\n\r\nNOTE: RDC allows you to use function pointers and virtual functions on the GPU which massively reduces build times and object-code bloat compared to compile-time polymorphism for everything.   Hopefully NVIDIA will fix this in the future but I don't know if they are even working this yet (we are asking our NVIDA contact).\r\n\r\nJust a warning about the upcoming future for the usage of Spack for ECP in a GPU dominated exascale world ...\r\n",
