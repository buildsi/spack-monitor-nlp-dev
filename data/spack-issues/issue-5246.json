    "body": "When compiling llvm recently, I ran into the fact that 16GB space for tmpfs `/tmp` was not sufficient and compilation failed due to insufficient disk space on that device. I was left googling around about what to do about that.\r\n\r\nI think Spack should back the build log, and if it found a phrase (or its variations) should propose modifying `~/.spack/config.yaml` to suggest an alternative `build_stage` with sufficient space.",
