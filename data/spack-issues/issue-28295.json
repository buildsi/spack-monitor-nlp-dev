This is what I've done in #28289 however I don't even know where to begin resolving this properly.\r\n\r\n``` console\r\n$ nm -C ~/projects/spack/var/spack/stage/spack-stage-diamond-2.0.11-yw7qbzesyog4a7tncq7yak5xw5q7m77z/spack-build-yw7qbze/CMakeFiles/diamond.dir/src/align/align.cpp.o | grep ExtensionPipeline\r\n0000000000000000 W ExtensionPipeline::Swipe::Pipeline::~Pipeline()\r\n0000000000000000 W ExtensionPipeline::Swipe::Pipeline::~Pipeline()\r\n0000000000000000 W ExtensionPipeline::Swipe::Pipeline::~Pipeline()\r\n0000000000000000 n ExtensionPipeline::Swipe::Pipeline::~Pipeline()\r\n                 U vtable for ExtensionPipeline::BandedSwipe::Pipeline\r\n                 U vtable for ExtensionPipeline::Swipe::Pipeline\r\n```\r\nand the outside of spack result\r\n``` console\r\n$ nm -C CMakeFiles/diamond.dir/src/align/align.cpp.o | grep ExtensionPipeline\r\n0000000000000000 W ExtensionPipeline::Swipe::Pipeline::~Pipeline()\r\n0000000000000000 W ExtensionPipeline::Swipe::Pipeline::~Pipeline()\r\n0000000000000000 W ExtensionPipeline::Swipe::Pipeline::~Pipeline()\r\n0000000000000000 n ExtensionPipeline::Swipe::Pipeline::~Pipeline()\r\n                 U vtable for ExtensionPipeline::BandedSwipe::Pipeline\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\r\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
