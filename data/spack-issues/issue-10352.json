When I look in the py-pytest package I see the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\ndepends_on('py-pathlib2@2.2.0:', when='^python@:3.5', type=('build', 'run'))\r\n```\r\nwhich should mean that for versions of Python up to 3.5, py-pathlib2 should be installed. Yet, it isn't installed. I had to install it and load it manually.",
