    "body": "The changes in this pull request add preliminary support for configuring the utilities that Spack uses in order to fetch archives from the web.  This preliminary support includes the following features:\n- The addition of `fetchers.yaml` as the recognized configuration file for Spack fetchers.\n- The `show_status` configuration option, which can be used to specify whether or not Spack displays a progress bar when downloading archives (useful since the progress bar for `curl` is broken in many environments).\n\nI'm hoping to extend this set of configuration options sometime soon to make it possible to configure Spack's default archive fetcher (i.e. adding an option like `fetcher: (curl|wget|...)`).  Other configuration options could also be added to solve the problems discussed in #69 and  #895.\n\nPlease let me know if there are any problems with this implementation or any improvements that I can make to it!\n",
