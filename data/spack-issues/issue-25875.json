    "body": "This commit removes all prior versions of log4cxx since log4cxx has moved to now using CMake instead of autotools as of 0.12.0. If prior versions of log4cxx are still desired, I suggest a Log4cxxLegacy package be defined. Please let me know if you want it added to this PR.\r\n\r\nThere is only a single known spack package that depends on log4cxx and it is libsakura and it does NOT specify a version.",
