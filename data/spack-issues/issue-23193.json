    "body": "The cce fortran compiler outputs `-L /path/to/foo` flags with a space between them. The configure script for `mpich` parses these flags incorrectly, leading to a blank `-L` flag on the compile line which causes an error.\r\n\r\nThis could be resolved by patching pre-configure, but I was unable to make such a patch work and resorted to a post-configure patch.",
