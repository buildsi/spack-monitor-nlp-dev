    "body": "Sometimes when `remove_file` is called on a link, that link is missing (perhaps ctrl-C happened halfway through a previous action, a `make clean` went rogue, ...). As removing a non-existent file is no problem, this patch changes the behaviour so Spack continues rather than erroring. \r\n\r\nCurrently you would see\r\n```ValueError: /path/to/my/env/.spack-env/view/share/info/dir is not a link tree!```\r\nand now it continues silently.
