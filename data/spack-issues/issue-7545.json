    "body": "Fixes #7543. @peetsv \r\n\r\nAdds the latest version of MPFR, which builds and passes all tests for me on macOS 10.13.3 with Clang 9.0.0.\r\n\r\nThe MPFR developers are some of the few people I've seen who actually release patches to fix bugs in older versions of software. They release these patches in two forms: individual patches and cumulative patches. I was using individual patches in #3506, but after #7193 was merged, the order in which patches are applied is no longer the order in which they are listed in the package, causing them to conflict (see #7543). This PR replaces the individual patches with cumulative patches and adds patches for older releases as well.\r\n\r\nNote that some of these patches are fairly large. Spack does support fetching patches from the internet, but I don't think I'm comfortable fetching patches remotely without checksumming them. And since the cumulative patches are updated continuously as bugs are discovered, checksumming them would just lead to headaches.\r\n\r\nPinging @alalazo and @davydden who have had opinions on long patches in the past.",
