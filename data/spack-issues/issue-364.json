    "body": "Since my last patch didn't get traction, here is a new approach to building gcc on Darwin:\n- Add a variant specifying whether to build with binutils, defaulting to true\n- Auto-detect whether this is Darwin; if so, set binutils and gold defaults to false, as they don't work on Darwin\n- Disable Go, which doesn't build on Darwin\n- Clean up handling configure options\n",
