    "body": "This PR also slightly changes the behavior in ci_rebuild().\r\nWe now still attempt to submit `spack install` results to CDash\r\neven if the initial registration failed due to connection issues.\r\n\r\nThis commit follows in the spirit of #24299. We do not want `spack install`\r\nto exit with a non-zero status when something goes wrong while attempting to\r\nreport results to CDash.",
