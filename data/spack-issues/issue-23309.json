    "body": "fixes #23275\r\n\r\nThere are many reports of packages failing due to binutils default of ~plugins.\r\n\r\nEither concretizer issues (because some packages now depend on binutils+plugins and some just on binutils -- the latter defaults to ~plugins, and the old concretizer is not enough to toggle that) or actual compilation issues.\r\n\r\nPreviously ~plugins did not map to the --disable-plugins, and you would still get plugins even if you didn't ask for it, so a previous pr just uncovered that a bunch of packages weren't configured properly.\r\n\r\nThis PR is to make the old concretizer happy, but doesn't solve the actual problem that packages should depend on binutils+plugins if they require plugins.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
