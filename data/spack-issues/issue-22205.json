    "body": "Adds several EpetraExt_BUILD_* options as well as an Amesos2_ENABLE_Basker\r\noption. Adds `none` as an option to `gotype=`, which should be among the\r\noptions since 'none' is specifically handled later in the package\r\ndefinition.\r\n\r\nAdds `stokhos` and `trilinoscouplings` as options in spack which already\r\nare available in CMake for Trilinos (e.g. Trilinos_ENABLE_Stokhos:BOOL=)\r\n\r\nAs a result of these changes, Xyce will be able to build against Trilinos installed with Spack.",
