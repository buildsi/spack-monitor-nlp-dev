    "body": "This PR adds the new Ginkgo versions 1.1.1 and in particular 1.2.0 which provide full HIP support for the library.\r\n\r\nI do not think there is currently a `hip` package in spack so I simply use a `variant` for this, and suppose that the system has all the correct dependencies in the default paths. Technically, we also depend on hipthrust, hipsparse and hipblas as well.\r\n\r\nThe new patch accounts for an issue which only appeared when building the Ginkgo through spack. It is (will very soon be) fixed in develop, see https://github.com/ginkgo-project/ginkgo/pull/585",
