    "body": "I couldn't seem to find an issue dedicated to this bug. I'm using Spack on Blue Waters (Cray) for the first time and no matter what command I run I see the following warning message:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install zlib\r\n==> Warning: Could not detect module function from bash.

Module-related info:\r\n```console\r\n$ type module\r\nmodule is a function\r\nmodule () \r\n{ \r\n    if [[ $1 == \"purge\" ]]; then\r\n        echo \"\";\r\n        echo \"BEWARE: Running \\\"module purge\\\" puts your environment in an unreliable state.\";\r\n        echo \"Doing so makes it difficult to debug problems or for support staff to help\";\r\n        echo \"you. Please structure your build so that you don't have to do this.\";\r\n        echo \"\";\r\n    fi;\r\n    if [[ $1 == \"PrgEnvLoad\" ]]; then\r\n        PRGMOD=`echo $LOADEDMODULES | tr \":\" \"\\n\" | grep PrgEnv`;\r\n        if [[ $PRGMOD == \"\" ]]; then\r\n            moduleraw load $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 2>&1;\r\n            return;\r\n        fi;\r\n        moduleraw swap $PRGMOD $2 $3 $4 $5 $6 2>&1;\r\n        return;\r\n    fi;\r\n    moduleraw $* 2>&1\r\n}\r\n```\r\n```console\r\n$ which modulecmd\r\n/opt/modules/3.2.10.4/bin/modulecmd\r\n```\r\nI have 3 concerns here:\r\n\r\n1. If there are two ways to locate `modulecmd`, why print a warning message unless both fail?\r\n2. Why are we looking for `modulecmd` multiple times instead of saving the result of the first search?\r\n3. Why do simple commands like `spack help` or `spack arch` also print these warnings? Are we always searching for `modulecmd`? Seems like a great way to slow Spack down to a grinding halt.\r\n\r\n@mamelara @becker33 @tgamblin ",
