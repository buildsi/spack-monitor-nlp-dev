    "body": "I also refactored the `Poppler` package to build with QT4. `TexStudio` expects `libpoppler-qt<version>` to be available when building against `poppler` (required for internal viewing of PDFs), so `^poppler+qt` is necessary. However, I couldn't get it to build with QT5, so trying QT4 seemed appropriate. I'll open an issue for the QT5 problem later.",
