    "body": "If `zlib` is an external package from `/usr`, `hdf5` is compiled with `-I/usr/include`, which breaks the include order of system headers on some systems. This is because we provide the installation prefix of `zlib` to the configure script of `hdf5` unconditionally. However, the only reason to provide the prefixes is to make sure that the libtool `*.la` files are correct.\r\n\r\nSince it was decided to remove libtool files for all packages by default (see #18850) and I don't see any reason to make an exception for `hdf5`, we can drop the related logic. This way, we don't have to introduce special treatment for external dependencies from the system directories. Instead, we rely on the Spack compiler wrapper to inject the required `-I` and `-L` flags when needed.",
