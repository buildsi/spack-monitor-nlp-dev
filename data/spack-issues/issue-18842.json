    "body": "After several tries, I was able to get the HIP stack installed through spack and configure our package to work with HIP. We also have a new released version, 1.3.0.\r\n\r\nQuestion:\r\nOur package currently supports C++14, and before it supported only C++11. Is there any way to mark a conflict on the C++ standard availability? For now, I use an `InstallError` at the configure step, but I'm not sure if that is the best way to do this.",
