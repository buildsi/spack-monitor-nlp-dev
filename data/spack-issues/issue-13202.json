    "body": "Fixes #13232\r\n\r\nSee https://gcc.gnu.org/install/build.html:\r\n\r\n> For a native build, the default configuration is to perform a 3-stage bootstrap of the compiler when \u2018make\u2019 is invoked. This will build the entire GCC system and ensure that it compiles itself correctly. It can be disabled with the --disable-bootstrap parameter to \u2018configure\u2019, but bootstrapping is suggested because the compiler will be tested more completely and could also have better performance.\r\n\r\nAlthough bootstrapping is _suggested_, I found that disabling it changed the build time from 2 hrs to 30 min.",
