    "body": "- Previously variant values had to be a tuple or a callable predicate.\r\n\r\n- This allows 'any' as shorthand for `lambda x: True` and type objects\r\n  as shorthand for \"any value of this type\", e.g.:\r\n\r\n```python\r\nvariant('some_value', values=any, description='anything at all')\r\nvariant('a_number', values=int, description='any integer')\r\n```\r\n\r\n- Makes variant definitions more readable, keeps lambdas out of\r\n  packages for common cases.\r\n\r\n@alalazo: do you think you'll have time to do multi-value variant documentation?",
