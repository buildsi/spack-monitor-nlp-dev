    "body": "This also makes https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/28800 obsolete.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the python build failures was that some cython sources are bundled with the tarball from hepforge. If cython is available when building, they *should* be regenerated, but due to a bug in the makefile they aren't. \r\n\r\nThe most robust way to fix this is to use the tarball from gitlab, which ensures that cython generates its own sources.",
