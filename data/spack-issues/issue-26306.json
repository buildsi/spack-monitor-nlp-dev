    "body": "I ran into an error helping @nicholas-sly set up an internal bootstrap source to work around a firewall issue. It turns out we don't currently provide a mechanism to tell Spack where to find the metadata associated with the bootstrap source for binary bootstrapping.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a single config option `metadata_path` for any binary cache bootstrapping source. It's an optional value. Relative paths are resolved relative to `$spack/share/spack/bootstrap/$name` and absolute paths are used directly.\r\n\r\n@alalazo ",
