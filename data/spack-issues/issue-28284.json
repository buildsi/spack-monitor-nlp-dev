A number of dependencies seem to have issues. My main question is:\r\n\r\n- Would it be possible for you to add a `spack install paraview %apple-clang` on macOS to your CI pipeline, so these issues get caught earlier and building ParaView with Spack on macOS remains functional?\r\n\r\nIssues I found so far:\r\n\r\n- `libtiff` fails to compile with `../version:1:1: error: expected unqualified-id` errors. Same issue as my comment here: https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/26559#issuecomment-1006663760. I managed to patch this, but badly.\r\n- `libtheora`: [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7823426/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n- `cfitsio`: [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7823428/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\nAt that point I stopped debugging and compiled with GCC instead.\r\n\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
