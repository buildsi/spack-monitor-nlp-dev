    "body": "`spack -V` stopped working when we added the `releases/latest` tag to track the most recent release. It started just reporting the version, even on a `develop` checkout. We need to tell it to *only* search for tags that start with `v`, so that it will ignore `releases/latest`.\r\n\r\n`spack -V` also would print out unwanted git eror output on a shallow clone.\r\n\r\n- [x] add `--match 'v*'` to `git describe` arguments\r\n- [x] route error output to `os.devnull`",
