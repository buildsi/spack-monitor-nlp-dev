But I can't tell if this is exactly the same, or the same maintainer (note there are no releases).\r\n\r\nAnd Parmgridgen for the homepage (and old personal site) is totally gone.\r\n\r\npyaenum is from pypi, and it looks to have switched from Bitbucket to GitHub.\r\n\r\nI'll be opening a PR shortly that has fixes for packages, and these can be further discussed.",
