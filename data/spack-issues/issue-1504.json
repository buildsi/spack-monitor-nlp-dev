    "body": "The changes in this pull request make the following improvements to the `exodusii` package:\n- Update the package version to a more recent and stable version of `exodusii`.\n- Improve the patching process for the package so that it utilizes more reliable and portable methods.\n- Add the `+mpi` variant, which allows the package to be built with support for parallel processing.\n- Add the `maxdims=int` and `maxvars=int` variants to the `netcdf` package, which helps the `exodusii` package better take advantage of this dependency (see [this document](https://github.com/gsjaardema/seacas/blob/8f94fe2e6cf1ae43249e4f0ef0ffb2223f7ea692/NetCDF-Mapping.md) for more information).\n\nPlease let me know if there are any problems with these updates and I'll fix them as soon as I can!\n",
