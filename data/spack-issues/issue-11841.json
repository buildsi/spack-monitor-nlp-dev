    "body": "When compiling llvm@flang-20180921 build fails because it tries to compile the `CppBackend` backend to LLVM which no longer exists in LLVM.  This is because for some reason the version check incorrectly decides that this is an older version of LLVM than 3.9.0.  This change extends this check to disable `CppBackend` for `spec.version`s that start with `fl`.",
