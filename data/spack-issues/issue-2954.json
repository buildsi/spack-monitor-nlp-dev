    "body": "When running `spack --profile` in Python 2.6, it would crash with the following error:\r\n```\r\nTypeError: runctx() got an unexpected keyword argument 'sort'\r\n```\r\n@alalazo It looks like this was introduced in [#2502](https://github.com/LLNL/spack/commit/7ea10e768ee1a7deab98ae538d916bbeeb0346b8#diff-2ab958d4c46d792e62ac6ba4f9146173R211). According to the [documentation](https://docs.python.org/2/library/profile.html#profile.runctx), `run` takes this parameter but `runctx` does not. Interestingly enough, it actually works in Python 2.7 even though it isn't in the documentation. But it makes the profiler crash in Python 2.6.",
