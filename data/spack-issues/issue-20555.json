This means that we need to duplicate the tests and explicitly declare `import_modules` for other build systems.\r\n\r\nTested that `gdal+python` now passes its tests. Previous behavior:\r\n```\r\n==> Testing package gdal-3.2.0-c5vyq6z\r\n==> Error: TypeError: unbound method test() must be called with PythonPackage instance as first argument (got Gdal instance instead)\r\n\r\n/Users/Adam/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/gdal/package.py:561, in test:\r\n        559    def test(self):\r\n        560        if '+python' in self.spec:\r\n  >>    561            PythonPackage.test(self)\r\n\r\nSee test log for details:\r\n  /Users/Adam/.spack/test/74n2cbqzyhgx3bcpmld3lkdc35jyb4vz/gdal-3.2.0-c5vyq6z-test-out.txt\r\n```",
