    "body": "This patch fix the issue of \"multiple definition of `pmi_opcaddy_t_class'\" when building OpenMPI 2.0.0 and 2.0.1. It has been merged into OpenMPI code but hasn't released on the latest 2.0.1. More discussion can be seen on https://www.mail-archive.com/users@lists.open-mpi.org/msg30048.html and https://github.com/open-mpi/ompi/pull/2131/files . Also see #2950 .\r\n\r\nI've sucessfully built OpenMPI 2.0.1 with both gcc 5.4.0 and intel 16.0.3 after patching.\r\n\r\nPatch credits go to Gilles Gouaillardet and Limin Gu. I just regenerated a patch file locally according to that git commit after my failing attempts to apply the pre-configured patch file.",
