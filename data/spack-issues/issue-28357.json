    "body": "To make the behavior of `spack env activate` / `spack load` and `module load`\nof spack-generated modules more alike, I'm proposing to set `autoload: direct`\nas a default from Spack 0.18.0.\n\nPeople who like to do dependency management by hand can still do that by\noverriding config to use `autoload: none`, so it's not terribly breaking.\n\nThis is mostly nice for people who use `lmod`, since `lmod` has reasonable\nsupport for managing dependencies. For `tcl` we are stuck with our\nif-not-loaded-load logic, but that's OK...\n\n",
