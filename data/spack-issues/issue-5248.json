    "body": "I culled this from my orig. comments in #2532\r\n\r\nMy first thought for this is for failures installing and/or testing a package.\r\n\r\nThere are two pieces to this suggestion...\r\n\r\n1. Assembling package install/use provenance for a fully detailed bug report\r\n    - package version information\r\n    - patches applied\r\n    - variants settings\r\n    - dependencies and their versions and variants\r\n    - OS and compiler info, etc.\r\n    - Failures during tests/checks could also include test stdout/stderr\r\n1. Getting the resulting information to the right people\r\n    - the right people are the developers of the package Spack is installing\r\n        - These may or may not be the same people who wrote Spack's `package.py` (e.g. the _maintainers_) file (see #5230)\r\n    - probably via some email\r\n    - package.py file would need something like `report-bugs(<some-email-address>` field\r\n\r\nStep one could be done automatically maybe as part of a `spack install --assemble-bug-report` command or something. In other words, it could be something that is requested as part of an install. Step two could be handled either manually or, if package's know their bug-report email addresses, by an additional spack command or `spack install` subcommand.",
