    "body": "Reading the [mirror documentation](http://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/mirrors.html), seems that to create a mirror with a list of packages it is necessary to download all the packages into your local machine and then create the mirror (please correct me if I'm wrong). This list of packages grouped together afterwards could be located in web server. \r\n\r\nThis approach is perfect for a small amount of packages for personal use or to provide a concrete stack of package with an specific version each one. But, IMHO it is not scalable when the list counts with thousands of packages or when this list is changing regularly (adding new versions, adding new packages...)\r\n\r\nSo, is there any way to declare a common web address where spack will have to try to fetch the tarfile of a package before going to the download url of the package recipe without using a created mirror?  \r\n\r\nI would like to add a new line to the `mirror.yaml` file just pointing to this web server where I have all the used software and fetching there packages in first place.
