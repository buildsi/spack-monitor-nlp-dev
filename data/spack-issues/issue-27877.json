    "body": "The goal of this work is to run stand-alone tests from `spack ci` when the `--tests` option is used.  When the option is used, the stand-alone tests are run **after** a **successful** build of the package.  Test results are collected and report(able) using CDash.\r\n\r\nTODO:\r\n\r\n- [x] Include the equivalent of the architecture information, or at least the host target, in the CDash output\r\n- [x] Upload stand-alone test results files as  `test` artifacts\r\n- [x] Confirm tests are run in GitLab\r\n- [x] Ensure CDash results are uploaded as artifacts\r\n- [x] Resolve issues with CDash build-and test results appearing on same row of the table \r\n- [x] Add unit tests  as needed\r\n- [x] Investigate why some (dependency) packages don't have test results (e.g., related from other pipelines)\r\n~- [ ] Possibly add full hash in build name -- Scott Wittenburg is working on a significant change in this area ATM~\r\n- [x] Ensure proper parsing and reporting of skipped tests (as `not run`) .. post- #28701 merge\r\n- [ ] Restore the proper CDash URL",
