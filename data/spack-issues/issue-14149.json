    "body": "I'm trying to install Bazel on a Debian machine. The machine has 8 GB of RAM so it shouldn't pose any problem, yet the build fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Building bazel [Package]\r\n==> Executing phase: 'bootstrap'\r\n==> Executing phase: 'install'\r\n==> Error: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'output/bazel'\r\n\r\n/projects/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/bazel/package.py:136, in install:\r\n        134    def install(self, spec, prefix):\r\n        135        mkdir(prefix.bin)\r\n  >>    136        install('output/bazel', prefix.bin)\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhen I inspect spack-build-out.txt, I see that the build failed with a `java.lang.OutOfMemoryError` exception. I read somewhere that it might be that javac isn't allocating enough (despite the machine having plenty).\r\n\r\nAny has this error? How could the Bazel package be updated to avoid it?",
