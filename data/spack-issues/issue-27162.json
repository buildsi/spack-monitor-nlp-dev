    "body": "Use setup_run_environment to search for libraries and set env variables for module generation. \r\n\r\nOther non-spack builds rely on these variables.\r\n\r\nLibraries are installed with CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR, which can be lib or lib64 depending on the machine, which makes it impossible to hardcode through modules.yaml.\r\n\r\nI know this is a little hacky,  but the documentation says to use setup_run_environment to add module variables, and I don't know of any other way to query the lib directory.",
