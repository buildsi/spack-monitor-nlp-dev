Python 3.8.7 available within SPACK.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\nError messages varying, perhaps due to unavailable components?\r\n\r\nE.g., `spack install julia@master arch=linux-debian9-x86_64`:\r\n```\r\n(...)\r\n==> julia: Executing phase: 'install'\r\n==> Error: Exception occurred in writer daemon!\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/.auto/home/SPACK2021/lib/spack/llnl/util/tty/log.py\", line 768, in _writer_daemon\r\n    line = _retry(in_pipe.readline)()\r\n  File \"/.auto/home/SPACK2021/lib/spack/llnl/util/tty/log.py\", line 830, in wrapped\r\n    return function(*args, **kwargs)\r\n  File \"/usr/lib/python3.5/encodings/ascii.py\", line 26, in decode\r\n    return codecs.ascii_decode(input, self.errors)[0]\r\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 6: ordinal not in range(128)\r\n==> Error: ProcessError: Command exited with status -13:\r\n    'make' '-j16'\r\n\r\n3 warnings found in build log:\r\n(... irrelevant for now, it seems)\r\n```\r\nthis looks like `/usr/bin/python3`, 3.5.3 in Stretch, was used instead of Spack's `python`?\r\n\r\nRunning the same command on `linux-centos7-haswell`,\r\n```\r\n(...)\r\n==> julia: Executing phase: 'install'\r\n==> Error: Exception occurred in writer daemon!\r\nTraceback (most recent call last):\r\n  File \"/home/SPACK2021/lib/spack/llnl/util/tty/log.py\", line 782, in _writer_daemon\r\n    log_file.write(_strip(line))\r\n  File \"/home/SPACK2021/lib/spack/llnl/util/tty/log.py\", line 69, in _strip\r\n    return _escape.sub('', line)\r\nUnicodeDecodeError: 'ascii' codec can't decode byte 0xe2 in position 9: ordinal not in range(128)\r\n==> Error: ProcessError: Command exited with status 2:\r\n    'make' '-j8' 'install'\r\n\r\n3 warnings found in build log:\r\n(...)\r\n```\r\ni.e., no reference to \"where this came from\".\r\nWhatever injects UTF-8 there... is, in the end, this a Spack issue and not a Julia one??\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
