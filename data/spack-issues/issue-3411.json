Was introduced by #3378.\r\n\r\nPreviously, this would fail with a NoSuchMethodError:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    class Package(object):\r\n        # this is the default implementation\r\n        def some_method(self):\r\n            ...\r\n\r\n    class Foo(Package):\r\n        @when('platform=cray')\r\n        def some_method(self):\r\n            ...\r\n\r\n        @when('platform=linux')\r\n        def some_method(self):\r\n            ...\r\n```\r\n\r\n@mamelara @becker33: This error would happen after #3378 was merged when installing dependents of `pkg-config`.\r\n\r\nThis fixes the implementation of `@when` so that the superclass method\r\nwill be invoked when no subclass method matches.\r\n\r\nAdds tests to ensure this works, as well.",
