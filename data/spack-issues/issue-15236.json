    "body": "`spack env activate myenv` doesn't seem to load system-provided modules.\r\n\r\nHere is an example: on Theta I have boost (along with other packages) already installed as a system-provided module, and I tell spack about it as follows in my packages.yaml file:\r\n\r\n```\r\n   boost:\r\n        modules:\r\n            boost@1.64.0 arch=cray-cnl6-mic_knl: boost/gnu/1.64.0\r\n        buildable: False\r\n```\r\n\r\nI created an environment `myenv` as follows:\r\n```\r\nspack env create myenv\r\nspack env activate myenv\r\nspack add boost\r\nspack add X # where X is a package that depends on boost\r\nspack install\r\n```\r\nThis installs everything correctly and spack is picking up the boost from the system.\r\n\r\nHowever later, if I activate the environment, it doesn't load the boost module. I have to explicitely do `module load boost/gnu/1.64.0`.\r\n\r\nThis happens to all the packages that are system-provided as modules.",
