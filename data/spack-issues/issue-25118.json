    "body": "You can now use Github[ issue templates](https://docs.github.com/en/communities/using-templates-to-encourage-useful-issues-and-pull-requests/syntax-for-issue-forms) to produce pretty cool forms. I thought those could be cool for the spack repo. (You can try those changes out on my repo: https://github.com/gpotter2/spack/issues/new/choose)\r\n\r\nI have converted the existing templates with a minor tweaks:\r\n- ~~removed the \"please ping maintainers clause\" because apparently you now have a bot that does this automatically (?)~~ (added. see the comment below)\r\n\r\nYou are free to provide feedback, modify this or not use it at all. It's a cool feature if you ask me, and it makes the issue templates much more readable.\r\n\r\nHere are a few screenshots:\r\n\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10530980/127248757-6ba78697-639b-4d5a-a41d-9b4363c1e289.png)\r\n![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/10530980/127248265-547185a8-bbf8-4646-997a-2886a9a9c8ef.png)",
