    "body": "For each spack build I would ideally like to have a copy of the building log and a copy of the package.py deposited the the install prefix.\nMy current work-around is to (set use_tmp_stage = False in **init**.py) and build with the --keep-stage flag. This is not ideal because I am now building in a shared slow permanent filesystem.\nI would like to have the option of building in a local fast filesystem, but keeping a copy of the build log and package.py in my install prefix.\n\nThanks\nCormac.\n",
