    "body": "### Rationale\r\nIt would mean one less step for users in creating python packages.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\nlocation of link to tar files in pypi.org goes like `pythonhosted.org...`. For example:\r\n```\r\nhttps://files.pythonhosted.org/packages/f9/bd/10398e2c2d2070cc8a9c7153abfbd4ddb2895a2c52a32722ab8689e0cc7d/pyPEG2-2.15.2.tar.gz\r\n```\r\nHowever, in spack `pypi.io` type link is preferred. For example, the pypi.io link for the above example would be:\r\n```\r\nhttps://pypi.io/packages/source/p/pypeg2/pyPEG2-2.15.2.tar.gz\r\n```\r\nThe logic of going from a give pythonhosted type link to pypi.io link is simple. This is just a matter of where and when to modify this url change in spack classes/functions involved in `spack create` call\r\n\r\n@adamjstewart \r\n",
