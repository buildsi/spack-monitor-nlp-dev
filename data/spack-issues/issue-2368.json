    "body": "The latest version of [nose](http://nose.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) starts with the following note to users:\r\n> Nose has been in maintenance mode for the past several years and will likely cease without a new person/team to take over maintainership. New projects should consider using Nose2, py.test, or just plain unittest/unittest2.\r\n\r\nI was wondering if after `v0.10` we should consider moving to [py.test](http://docs.pytest.org/en/latest/) or we should remain with the version of nose that's currently in `lib/external`. \r\n\r\nIn case there's consensus around this, I wouldn't mind experimenting with `py.test` to see how much this change will be doable / painful.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
