    "body": "I'm not sure the mpifileutils package ever properly built, especially if trying to use a system libarchive. In any case, I have a bunch of fixes here:\r\n- this package will not work on macs\r\n- all dependency paths are set on the `./configure` line, rather than relying on pkg-config\r\n- the mfu sub tools need to include `src/common`",
