    "body": "While trying to fix `py-spyder` (#9205) I ran into a couple of problems (i.e. Qt, at least with version 4.8.6 doesn't build `webkit` even if asked nicely). Trying to debug this lead to the following:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack configure qt@4.8.6\r\n==> Error: Package qt has no configure phase, or its configure phase is not separated from install\r\n...\r\n```\r\nI think this has to do with the different overrides for different versions of Qt. Nevertheless I'd expect the command to work or at least report a truthful error message.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nNothing that should be relevant for this. Can be reproduced at least on the HEAD of #9207 and the current develop (ccbff6e). I will not be able to look into this myself before the beginning of next week.",
