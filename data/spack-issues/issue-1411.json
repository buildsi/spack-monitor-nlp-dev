    "body": "Hi,\n\nI'm trying to use the system-wide version of openmpi, using a packages.yaml file such as:\n\n``` yaml\npackages:\n  openmpi:\n    paths:\n      openmpi@1.10.3%gcc@6.1.1: /usr\n    buildable: False\n```\n\nor\n\n``` yaml\npackages:\n  openmpi:\n    paths:\n      openmpi@1.10.3%gcc@6.1.1  arch=linux--x86_64: /usr\n    buildable: False\n```\n\nbut I get a ValueError. Is this related to wrong detection of my system name, and can I override this detection somehow?\n",
