    "body": "We have a release workflow, but it isn't documented anywhere.  This PR fixes that.\r\n\r\nWhile I was at it, I also removed references to the `master` branch from Spack.  We never use `master`, and every release series has its own `releases/vX.Y` branch that we advise users to check out.  Point releases may be non-chronological (e.g., 0.14.3 may come out after 0.15.0) so it doesn't make sense to keep a single stable branch.\r\n\r\nI also reworked the PTY support to not use `master` terminology.  It now uses `controller` / `child` to describe how the PTYs function.\r\n\r\nOnce this PR is merged, we can delete the `master` branch from Spack.\r\n\r\n- [x] Mention releases and stable release branches in `README.md`\r\n- [x] Document Spack's releases process and branch structure\r\n- [x] Step-by-step guide for making a major release\r\n- [x] Step-by-step guide for making a point release\r\n- [x] Document Spack's releases process and branch structure\r\n- [x] Change `master`/`child` to `controller`/`minion` in the PTY code\r\n- [x] Removes references to the `master` branch from Travis and GitHub Actions ",
