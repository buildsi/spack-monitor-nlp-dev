    "body": "Hi\r\n\r\nWithout this change ```-DCUDA_ARCH``` will be defined even when no value's set.  This causes it to be used as cmake argument which then makes relion think it's compiling with ```+cuda``` when that's not the case.\r\n\r\nThe latest change will only use ```cuda_arch``` variant when it's explicitly used like ```cuda_arch=6.0```.",
