    "body": "<!-- Explain, in a clear and concise way, the command you ran and the result you were trying to achieve.\r\nExample: \"I ran `spack find` to list all the installed packages and ...\" -->\r\n\r\nWhen I install within an environment a package XXX which depends on a package YYY which  is defined as external in the `spack.yaml`, the spec of the package YYY appears when doing  `spack find` (and what is more annoying, can cause 'conflicts' if a variant of the package XXX is actually built by spack in another context when doing 'spack load XXX').\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n1. clone and 'source' a fresh spack\r\n2. unzip the provided archive in a directory DIR \r\n[spack-external-packages.zip](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/5143181/spack-external-packages.zip)\r\n3. in `DIR/spack-env`, change `./` under the `repos` section to `DIR/spack-env` (relative path here does not seems to work)\r\n4. in the directory DIR, do  `spack -e spack-env install foo`\r\n5. `spack find`\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-711-7dd58c7ed\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.2\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [ ] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
