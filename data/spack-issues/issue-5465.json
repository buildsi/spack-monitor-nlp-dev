    "body": "My recent update to `git` (#5430) requires that `pcre` be built with `+jit`.\r\n\r\nNow I'm unable to build `shiny-server`.  It depends on `git` (which depends on `pcrc+jit`) and on `pcre`.\r\n\r\n```\r\n==> Error: An unsatisfiable variant constraint has been detected for spec:\r\n\r\n    pcre@8.40%gcc@5.4.0~jit+utf arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n\r\n\r\nwhile trying to concretize the partial spec:\r\n\r\n    git@2.14.1%gcc@5.4.0 arch=linux-centos7-x86_64\r\n\r\n\r\ngit requires pcre variant +jit, but spec asked for ~jit\r\n```\r\n\r\nI can fix it for my case by defaulting to `pcre+jit` in my `etc/spack/packages.yaml` file, but I'm not sure that's the right thing for the project.\r\n\r\nSuggestions?",
