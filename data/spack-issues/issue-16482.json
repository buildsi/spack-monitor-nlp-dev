    "body": "https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/15158#pullrequestreview-406231659 mentioned several ways that the documentation for `spack external find` could be substantially improved:\r\n\r\n* Provide a code example of implementing `determine_spec_details` for a package\r\n* Explain how to define executables to look for (and also e.g. that they are treated as regular expressions and so can pull in unexpected files).\r\n* Add the \"why\" for a couple of constraints (i.e. explain that this logic only works for build/run deps because it examines `PATH` for executables)",
