    "body": "This prints out debug information about which specs are applying which constraints.\r\n\r\nSpack's greedy concretizer can make mistakes that later cause it to think that a spec cannot be concretized. See for example https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/14792. At the point where it encounters a conflict, it is difficult to know which other specs applied the constraints that are now causing a conflict. This prints out a list of all the constraints applied by all specs. If you get an error like\r\n\r\n```\r\npython requires gettext variant ~libxml2, but spec asked for +libxml2\r\n```\r\n\r\nyou can pipe the debug output to a file and then grep for instances of\r\n\r\n* dependencies requiring gettext+libxml2\r\n* dependencies asking for gettext by itself (and if this occurs early enough in the concretization, Spack can choose a default value for libxml2 that later creates a conflict)",
