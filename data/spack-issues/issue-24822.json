    "body": "At time of writing, the Graphviz package file contains the following:\r\n\r\n```python\r\n    @when('%clang platform=darwin')\r\n    def patch(self):\r\n        # When using Clang, replace GCC's libstdc++ with LLVM's libc++\r\n        mkdirs = ['cmd/dot', 'cmd/edgepaint', 'cmd/mingle', 'plugin/gdiplus']\r\n        filter_file(r'-lstdc\\+\\+', '-lc++', 'configure.ac',\r\n                    *(d + '/Makefile.am' for d in mkdirs))\r\n\r\n    @when('%apple-clang')\r\n    def patch(self):\r\n        # When using Clang, replace GCC's libstdc++ with LLVM's libc++\r\n        mkdirs = ['cmd/dot', 'cmd/edgepaint', 'cmd/mingle', 'plugin/gdiplus']\r\n        filter_file(r'-lstdc\\+\\+', '-lc++', 'configure.ac',\r\n                    *(d + '/Makefile.am' for d in mkdirs))\r\n```\r\n\r\nIIUC this is working around https://gitlab.com/graphviz/graphviz/-/issues/163. This was resolved in Graphviz commit ed155274912f3eded8833ae644625e6017637634, which made it into Graphviz version 2.46.0. So these steps should be unnecessary for \u22652.46.0.\r\n\r\nCC @cessenat ",
