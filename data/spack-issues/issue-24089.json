    "body": "This PR fixes a problem where `spack ci generate` could generate invalid yaml because the `needs` of some jobs did not appear as job names in the file.  The following example spec, due to how a package and its dependency have different architectures, would previously cause such a breakage:\r\n\r\n```\r\nreadline@8.1%gcc@9.2.0 target=skylake ^pkgconf target=x86_64\r\n```\r\n",
