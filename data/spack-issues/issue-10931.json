    "body": "There were samples of output from different compilers in the docstrings of the various `default_version` methods. This PR:\r\n\r\n- [x] Adds tests that use the output above to ensure that the correct version is detected for each compiler\r\n- [x] Refactors the `default_version` method to make it more testable by dividing the part that produces the output from the one that tries to extract a version from it",
