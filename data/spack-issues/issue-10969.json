    "body": "Also adds hooks to environment setup scripts.  Instead of symlinking `handle-xyz.sh` to `$SPACK_ROOT`, it is sourced.  If the file is not found (e.g.: due to a different version of spack being mounted to `$SPACK_ROOT`), then a static version of the setup files are evaluated inline.\r\n\r\nAlso adds a `spack spec` command near the end so that prebuilt caches are included in the resulting images.",
