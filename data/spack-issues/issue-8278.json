    "body": "Fixes #8199 \r\n\r\nSpack's build log error parser is a direct port of CTest's. The regexes it uses may work well for CMake, but they often trigger false positives for Autotools-based packages (see #8199). To reproduce this, uncomment any patches for the `fyba` package and try installing on macOS or with GCC 6.\r\n\r\nPreviously, any line containing `text:number: ` was matched. This regex has been removed. This resulted in the following error message no longer being caught:\r\n```\r\nINQTID.cpp:18:11: fatal error: 'sys/vfs.h' file not found\r\n```\r\nI removed the requirement for `: fatal error` to be preceded by a space to solve this. _Is the line after this now redundant?_\r\n\r\n### Pros\r\n\r\nFewer false positives for Autotools-based packages.\r\n\r\n### Cons\r\n\r\nMore false negatives?",
