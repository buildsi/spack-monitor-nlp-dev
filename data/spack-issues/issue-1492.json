    "body": "When I run `spack compiler find` on CentOS 6, it picks up all of the compilers I want. But when I run the same command on RHEL 5, it doesn't pick up any new compilers. I assume it's because all of the compilers are already in there, just for a different OS. Spack should add the OS to the existing compilers.\n",
