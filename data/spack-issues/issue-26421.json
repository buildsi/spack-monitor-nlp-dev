    "body": "fixes #26420 \r\n\r\nSee discussion in the issue. With this we can bootstrap `clingo` from sources and link to a shared `libstdc++`. The downside is that we add a dependency that is not tracked by Spack's model (`clingo -> libstdc++`) so there may be other kind of failures we can't track at the moment.",
