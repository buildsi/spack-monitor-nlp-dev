I do a fresh clone from github of spack and now when I try to build a package on my cray XC CLE 6.0up04 system I get this:\r\n\r\n/scratch1/users/hpp/spack@ga-fe1:/scratch1/users/hpp/spack> (develop)spack install libhio\r\n==> Error: Compiler configuration contains entries with duplicate specification (gcc@7.3.0, cray-cnl6-haswell) in the following files:\r\n\t/users/hpp/.spack/cray/compilers.yaml: 7 times\r\n\t/users/hpp/.spack/compilers.yaml: 7 times\r\n\r\n\r\nI use not to see this.  Anyone know what's going on?\r\n\r\n@junghans \r\n",
