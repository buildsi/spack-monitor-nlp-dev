    "body": "When I try to use spack to install netcdf on our own servers and Tianhe-2 supercomputer, it shows that the servers cannot resolve  Spack mirrors. I think it may be because of the network of servers. I also contacted with the engineer of Tianhe-2, he told me that they directly install library instead of using spack which is not very useful because of the complexity of supercomputer cluster. \r\n\r\nThe errors are as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\nh \r\n[blsc407@lon12%tianhe2-B ~]$ spack install netcdf-fortran \r\n==> Installing libsigsegv\r\n==> Searching for binary cache of libsigsegv\r\n==> Warning: No Spack mirrors are currently configured\r\n==> No binary for libsigsegv found: installing from source\r\n==> Fetching https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libsigsegv/libsigsegv-2.11.tar.gz\r\ncurl: (6) Couldn't resolve host 'ftpmirror.gnu.org'\r\n==> Fetching from https://ftpmirror.gnu.org/libsigsegv/libsigsegv-2.11.tar.gz failed.\r\n==> Error: FetchError: All fetchers failed for libsigsegv-2.11-xqiyghtlms7lwgexu3wh7zdtbw6lnytl\r\n\r\n/PARA/blsc407/spack-develop/lib/spack/spack/package.py:1051, in do_fetch:\r\n       1048                raise FetchError(\"Will not fetch %s\" %\r\n       1049                                 self.spec.format('{name}{@version}'), ck_msg)\r\n       1050\r\n  >>   1051        self.stage.create()\r\n       1052        self.stage.fetch(mirror_only)\r\n       1053        self._fetch_time = time.time() - start_time\r\n",
