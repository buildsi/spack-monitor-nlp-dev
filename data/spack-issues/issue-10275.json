    "body": "so when i install python modules for versions other than my system default, it will append the python version to the end, to make it clear what version of python it is linked to.\r\nLike so:\r\n   py-alabaster/0.7.10-py3.5.2\r\n   py-alabaster/0.7.10-py3.6.0\r\n   py-alabaster/0.7.10                             (D)\r\n\r\nPerl doesn't do that.\r\nIf i install perl-5.24.1, all the extensions will insist on that version, and trying to compile a second perl with all the extensions, it fails to write new lua files appended with the perl version.\r\n\r\nis there some way to force this?",
