    "body": "Make sure that `cmake~ownlibs` never depends on `openssl`, since it's a transitive dep through curl, not a direct dep. Only when cmake+ownlibs is used should we conditionally depend on openssl directly, because cmake does not / cannot bootstap it.\r\n\r\nThis PR also clarifies this in the description of the openssl variant.\r\n\r\n\r\n",
