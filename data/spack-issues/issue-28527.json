    "body": "This likely needs a bit more thought and testing, but this is a good draft of what I think we should do for Python libraries.\r\n\r\nNote that we only search `platlib`, not `purelib`. For most packages (at least ones that use setuptools), all files are installed to `platlib` if the package is not pure-Python. If things are installed in purelib instead of platlib, there likely aren't any libraries/headers anyway.\r\n\r\nCloses #14513 \r\nCloses #22475",
