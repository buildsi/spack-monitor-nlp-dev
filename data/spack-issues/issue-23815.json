I see these directories:\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ ls -l view\r\nlrwxrwxrwx 1 eschnetter users 75 May 20 09:00 view -> /home/eschnetter/src/CarpetX/Cactus/._view/nm4xsrwttcelwxk52vwmizwwnhxq4wd2\r\n$ ls -l ._view\r\ntotal 16\r\ndrwxr-xr-x 16 eschnetter users 8192 May 20 09:00 nm4xsrwttcelwxk52vwmizwwnhxq4wd2\r\ndrwxr-xr-x  9 eschnetter users 8192 May 19 22:42 ojcoqmogozxypeoozhzh5bzqzrbcslax\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe directory \"._view/ojcoqmogozxypeoozhzh5bzqzrbcslax\" is outdated. Spack should remove it.\r\n\r\nI believe I may have interrupted Spack while creating an earlier view, or it ran out of CPU time.\r\n\r\nSpack should remove all partial views when a new view is generated successfully.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.1-2761-d2e22d7fe4\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.9\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu18.04-skylake_avx512\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
