I see this:\r\n```\r\nlrwxrwxrwx blake14/blake14     0 2020-10-15 14:33 cudnn-7.6.5.32-10.1-linux-ppc64le-vbhtwfg4trkseuelk4e6626u6fjajapp/include -> /usr/WS2/blake14/deploy.spack/opt/spack/linux-rhel7-power9le/gcc-8.3.1/cudnn-7.6.5.32-10.1-linux-ppc64le-vbhtwfg4trkseuelk4e6626u6fjajapp/targets/ppc64le-linux/include\r\nlrwxrwxrwx blake14/blake14     0 2020-10-15 14:33 cudnn-7.6.5.32-10.1-linux-ppc64le-vbhtwfg4trkseuelk4e6626u6fjajapp/lib -> /usr/WS2/blake14/deploy.spack/opt/spack/linux-rhel7-power9le/gcc-8.3.1/cudnn-7.6.5.32-10.1-linux-ppc64le-vbhtwfg4trkseuelk4e6626u6fjajapp/targets/ppc64le-linux/lib\r\n```\r\n\r\nThese symbolic links point to my personal spack install directory.  They need to be relocated just like the rest of the paths.\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-1651-978d8ad\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.2\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-haswell\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n<!-- We encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively!\r\n\r\nIf you want to ask a question about the tool (how to use it, what it can currently do, etc.), try the `#general` channel on our Slack first. We have a welcoming community and chances are you'll get your reply faster and without opening an issue.\r\n\r\nOther than that, thanks for taking the time to contribute to Spack! -->\r\n",
