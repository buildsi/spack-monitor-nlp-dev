    "body": "fixes #29203\r\n\r\nThis PR fixes a subtle bug we have when importing Spack packages as Python modules that can lead to multiple module objects being created for the same package. It also fixes all the places in unit-tests where relying on the old bug was crucial to have a new \"clean\" state of the package class.\r\n\r\nThe gist of the fix is:\r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/alalazo/spack/blob/815557ffb1f598130453645e62b74b6b6a6bd1ca/lib/spack/spack/repo.py#L1104-L1108\r\n\r\nwhere we go through the Python importing protocol to retrieve the package classes instead of reloading them from sources again and again.",
