    "body": "Currently, abstract target/os constraints inherently include the platform on which Spack is running. This leads to situations where valid constraints/triggers in a `conflicts` directive are not mutually constrainable.\r\n\r\nThe `spack audit` code was raising an error if it could not constrain the constraint spec by each of its triggers. This led to spurious CI failures in #28850\r\n\r\nIncludes regression test, and TODO comment to revert if/when targets/os are handled differently.\r\n\r\n@sethrj this should fix the CI failure for your PR.",
