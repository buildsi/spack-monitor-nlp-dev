    "body": "Currently, when a build test fails, there isn't an easy way to see what caused it. Instead, Travis gives us the error message:\r\n\r\n> This log is too long to be displayed. Please reduce the verbosity of your build or download the raw log.\r\n\r\nThis PR reduces the verbosity of our build. I think our error parsing of the build log is good enough that we no longer need the full output.",
