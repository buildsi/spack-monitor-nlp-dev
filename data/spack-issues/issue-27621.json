    "body": "After changing my package manager recently from brew to spack I realised that there were a lot of uncrustify versions missing.\r\nSo I added all minor releases that are available in their [git repo](https://github.com/uncrustify/uncrustify).\r\nAlso added a patch to make `v0.73` installable which was only fixed in `v0.74`.\r\n\r\nPS: although I am pretty new to using spack I already see that the current version of using a general `Package` is not the best solution since it is actually a `AutotoolsPackage` for versions `<v0.64` and a `CMakePackge`for the rest. However I did not have the time yet to read fully into the API to make this PR perfect. If the maintainers think it is good as it is or has any quick edits let me know.\n\nCloses uncrustify/uncrustify#3400.",
