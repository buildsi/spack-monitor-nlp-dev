    "body": "Modifications:\r\n- [x] Added Python (>=2.7) unit tests to Github Actions and removed them from Travis\r\n- [x] Simplified the logic to enable coverage from `setup.sh`\r\n\r\nAt the moment all the jobs in Github Actions run with coverage. The timing is comparable to the same jobs in Travis. A caveat is that Github Actions doesn't support Python 2.6 - so Travis is necessary at least as long as we provide support for it.",
