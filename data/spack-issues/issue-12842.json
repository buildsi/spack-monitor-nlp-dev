    "body": "In #5132, we added a `test` deptype with the following properties:\r\n\r\n- Dependency is only added when `spack install --test` is specified\r\n- Doesn't affect the package hash\r\n- Performs same env modifications as `build` deptype\r\n\r\nThis PR adds one additional property:\r\n\r\n- Performs same modifications to `-I`, `-L`, and `-Wl,-rpath` in compiler wrapper as `link` deptype\r\n\r\nWhen we discussed #5132, one of the assumptions was that \"test\" dependencies only needed to be added to the `PATH` or `PYTHONPATH` to use them. However, this is not the case for all \"test\" dependencies. Specifically, `googletest` is needed as a \"test\" dependency for many packages, however it has no `prefix.bin` directory. It only has `prefix.include` and `prefix.lib` directories that are used to compile the unit tests of a package. This PR allows `googletest` to be RPATHed to the unit tests.\r\n\r\nOne concern I have is what happens when a unit test has many dependencies that we don't want RPATHed into the resulting executable. Could this be a problem? I want to make sure that `build` and `test` dependencies can still be uninstalled after installation without causing any unforeseen problems. Also, this won't affect the spec hash, right?",
