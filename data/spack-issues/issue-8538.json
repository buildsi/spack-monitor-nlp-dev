    "body": "valgrind moved from svn to a git repo:\r\n\r\nhttp://valgrind.org/downloads/repository.html\r\n\r\nWhile the svn repo listed in spack still fetches, it's not the latest and greatest. \r\nI needed the latest develop branch to build on macOS 10.13 w/ xcode 9\r\n\r\nThe new url uses the `git://` protocol, which worked for me at home -- however this isn't idea b/c since many companies block a wide range of ports and the git protocol uses 9418.  (I can't fetch from it while at work)\r\n\r\nI did also try:  https://sourceware.org/git/valgrind.git \r\n\r\nBut this hung spack:\r\n \r\n==> Trying to clone git repository: https://sourceware.org/git/valgrind.git \r\nfatal: dumb http transport does not support shallow capabilities",
