The package spec will be newly installed:\r\n\r\n-- linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake / gcc@9.3.0 ------------------------\r\n6erg6r3 readline@8.0%gcc\r\n==> Do you want to proceed? [y/N] y\r\n[+] /home/adam/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake/gcc-9.3.0/pkgconf-1.7.3-lwcroefxaeuqfg5nshj4wl7ps4allnsy\r\n[+] /home/adam/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake/gcc-9.3.0/ncurses-6.2-v3z5jtv4ztmho7onysxesbp2wqrrbn5x\r\n[+] /home/adam/spack/opt/spack/linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake/gcc-9.3.0/readline-8.0-6erg6r3ryymdcoplpwglxcfvqlpqaxxc\r\n```\r\nThis is the full output, it isn't actually rebuilding readline for some reason, it thinks it's already installed so it doesn't have to build it again.\r\n\r\nThe only local modification I have from develop is #17059, which is why I want to reinstall readline.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2-1395-4c976dfe6\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.2\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake (via WSL)\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
