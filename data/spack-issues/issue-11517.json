The first commit works both for `spack spec -I dealii@develop+symengine` and `spack spec -I dealii@develop+symengine^trilinos+debug`, but the second fails:\r\n\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec -I dealii@develop+symengine\r\nInput spec\r\n--------------------------------\r\n -   dealii@develop+symengine\r\n\r\nConcretized\r\n--------------------------------\r\n==> Error: multiple values are not allowed for variant \"build_type\"\r\n```\r\n\r\nAgain, pointing that something seems to be wrong with multi-valued variants and/or concretization with `^` constraints. @alalazo @tgamblin @scheibelp @adamjstewart any thoughts?\r\n\r\nEDIT: concretization works as expected if I help concretizer with `trilinos` debug variant:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec -I dealii@develop+symengine^trilinos+debug\r\n```\r\n",
