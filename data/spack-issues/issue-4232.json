    "body": "@alalazo This seems to be an unintended consequence of the addition of multi-valued variants. I tried installing a new package to a Spack installation from before multi-valued variants existed and now I see:\r\n```\r\n==> Error: CorruptDatabaseError: Invalid record in Spack database: hash: plrlzuulbe7huekbvkh4vl6rruimhkpi, cause: MultipleValuesInExclusiveVariantError: multiple values are not allowed for variant \"nprocs\"\r\n```\r\nIs this another case of \"Spack should use the package.py from when it was installed, not the current one\"?",
