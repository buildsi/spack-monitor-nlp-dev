    "body": "LHAPDF up to version 5 is a general purpose Fortran 77/90 interpolator, used for evaluating PDFs from discretised data files.\r\n\r\nThis package is similar to HepMC2 and HepMC3 in that it is reasonable to expect both to be installed simultaneously in environments (see e.g. https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/16892 for a discussion which applies here as well).\r\n\r\nLink: https://lhapdf.hepforge.org/lhapdf5/\r\n\r\n(Part of an effort to contribute spack packages from the Electron-Ion Collider repository to the broader NP and HEP community.)",
