    "body": "Some software packages such as `singularity` (currently working on adding it) need to be installed as root in order for them to work properly.\r\n\r\nWhat should be the strategy spack takes for these packages?\r\n\r\nSomething which makes sense to me is to add a boolean member variable to the package class like `install_as_root`. This then be inspected on install to determine whether `sudo` should be invoked to install the package. Of course this scheme will only work with pre-defined build systems like `AutotoolsPackage` for `CMakePackage`, and ad-hoc build systems will be left out.",
