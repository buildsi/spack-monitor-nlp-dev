    "body": "Currently Spack vendors `pytest` at a version which is three major versions behind the latest (3.2.5 vs. 6.2.4). We do that since v3.2.5 is the latest version supporting Python 2.6. Remaining so much behind the currently supported versions though might introduce some incompatibilities and is surely a technical debt.\r\n\r\nThis PR modifies Spack to:\r\n- [x] Use the vendored `pytest@3.2.5` only as a fallback solution, if the Python interpreter used for Spack doesn't provide a newer one\r\n- [x] Be able to parse `pytest --collect-only` in all the different output formats from v3.2.5 to v6.2.4 and use it consistently for `spack unit-test --list-*`\r\n- [x] Updating the unit tests in Github Actions to use a more recent `pytest` version",
