    "body": "closes #8916\r\n\r\nCurrently Spack ends with an error if asked to write lmod modules files and the 'core_compilers' entry is not found in `modules.yaml`. After this PR an attempt will be made to guess that entry and the site configuration file will be updated accordingly.\r\n\r\nThis is similar to what Spack already does to guess compilers on first run.\r\n\r\n@svenevs @SteVwonder ",
