    "body": "### Rationale\r\n\r\nIt's incredibly easy to shoot yourself in the foot when `--require-full-hash-match` is not the default. \r\n\r\nI believe https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/19665 is basically caused because I did the following:\r\n\r\n- `spack install clingo` pulls some packages from a binary cache\r\n- ... more commands ...\r\n- `spack install --require-full-hash-match mypkg` could skip some dependencies, cause they overlap with clingo, but `--require-full-hash-match` would have failed for those packages potentially.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nI'd rather have `--require-full-hash-match` to be the default. I'd rather exactly know that the package I installed was built from the same package.py as I have in front of me.\r\n\r\nping @scottwittenburg ",
