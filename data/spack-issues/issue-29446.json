    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\n\nI encountered an issue when building with the most recent Spack version where my override \r\n\r\n```\r\n    def setup_environment(self, spack_env, run_env):\r\n        if '+mpi' in self.spec:\r\n            spack_env.set('CXX', self.spec['mpi'].mpicxx)\r\n```\r\nis not being called during the install process, resulting in the build failing due to linker errors from undefined MPI symbols. Reverting to a version from January 25th resolved the issue. Looking at the Spack source, it seems to be happening because an override for  setup_build_environment has been added to AutotoolsPackage to resolve some MacOS compile issues which does not call out to the method in PackageBase which deals with the legacy support.\r\n\n\n### Error message\n\n_No response_\n\n### Information on your system\n\n[ckelly@login4.summit PerformanceAnalysis]$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.17.1-957-bed3a69498\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-power9le\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\nThis version works correctly.
