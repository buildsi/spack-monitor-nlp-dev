    "body": "Fixes some build issues that I introduced in #27798. The pyside2 build system must be doing something hacky because `pip install .` doesn't work, only `python setup.py install`.\r\n\r\nOther bugs I noticed: missing packaging dep, older versions only support older Python/wheel.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately I still see the following build issue:\r\n```\r\n/u/stewart1/spack/opt/spack/linux-rhel8-zen/gcc-8.5.0/qt-5.15.2-fmje75cmuy2k7rm6j3hzorzi7cpsowzc/include/QtGui/qopengl.h:141:13: fatal: 'GL/gl.h' file not found\r\n```\r\nHowever, earlier in the log I see:\r\n```\r\n-- GL Headers path:/u/stewart1/spack/opt/spack/linux-rhel8-zen/gcc-8.5.0/mesa-21.3.1-tipravmzsrv6ocqtytbdzlhj7ovoqild/include/GL/gl.h\r\n```\r\nI think this is a bug in their build system. Would report this but they don't use GitHub. Anyway, the package is better now that it was before, so I think this should be merged as is. Someone else can investigate the GL issue.",
