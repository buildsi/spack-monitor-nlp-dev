    "body": "The `MFrontGenericInterfaceSupport` project (`MGIS`) aims at proving tools (functions, classes, bindings, etc...) to handle behaviours written using `MFront` generic interface. For information about `MFront`, see <http://tfel.sourceforge.net>. `MFront` is available in `spack` through the `TFEL` package.\r\n\r\n\u200bThose tools are meant to be used by (`FEM`, `FFT`, etc.) solver developers. Permissive licences have been chosen to allow integration in open-source and proprietary codes.",
