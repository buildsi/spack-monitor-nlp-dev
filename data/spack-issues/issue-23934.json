    "body": "I think I've been to [this page](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/binary_caches.html) multiple times looking to create or download from a build cache, and the instances are far enough apart that I'm always confused about how to use caches! Specifically, it's currently kind of confusing to the reader to distinguish spack buildcache install and spack install, and it is not clear how to actually use a build cache once a mirror is added. Hopefully this little big of description can help (and I hope I got it right!)\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
