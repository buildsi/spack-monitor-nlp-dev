    "body": "This PR provides packages _apr_, _apr-util_ and _subversion_.  In this PR, I am not trying to build or install any of subversion's extra language bindings.  I only want to provide the basic package.\n\nI did add some notes to `subversion/package.py` to guide future development with respect to language bindings. On some system configurations, the Perl bindings will be needed for git-svn to work properly and the python bindings are used by subversion's hook system. In both cases, I'm unsure of how to install these extensions without root access. \n",
