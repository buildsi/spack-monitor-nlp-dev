    "body": "It would be very useful to be able to use definitions as requirements in specs so as to make environments very easy to share and reuse:\r\n\r\nFor example we declare the compiler, core compiler and mpi:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  definitions:\r\n    - mygcc: [ gcc@8.3.0 ]\r\n    - mybasegcc: [ gcc@4.8.5 ]\r\n    - mympi: [ mpich@3.3.2+slurm pmi=pmi2 ]\r\n\r\n  specs:\r\n  - matrix:\r\n    - [$mygcc]\r\n    - [% $mybasegcc]\r\n  \r\n  - matrix:\r\n    - [openblas@0.3.8, $mympi , fftw~mpi]\r\n    - [% mygcc ]\r\n  - matrix:\r\n    - [openfoam,  fftw]\r\n    - [^ $mympi]\r\n    - [% $mygcc]\r\n```\r\n\r\nAt present this isn't possible as `%$mygcc` is invalid syntax (needs expansion?) so even if we can define things to be installed they have to be added by hand when used as requirements:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  - matrix:\r\n    - [openblas, $mympi , fftw~mpi]\r\n    - [ \"%gcc@8.3.0\" ]\r\n  - matrix:\r\n    - [openfoam, fftw]\r\n    - [\"^mpich@3.3.2+slurm pmi=pmi2\"]\r\n    - [\"%gcc@8.3.0\"]\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n",
