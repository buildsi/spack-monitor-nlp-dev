    "body": "When running `spack install --log-format junit|cdash ...`, install errors were ignored. This made spack continue building dependents of failed install, ignoring `--fail-fast`, and exit 0 at the end.\r\n\r\nI found it was the `InfoCollector` class not forwarding exceptions after gathering them for report.\r\n\r\n**Slight behavior change:** (but for the best) because dependents of a failed install are now correctly skipped (like without `--log-format`), they might not be reported the same as before in the report file (skipped build is not an error).\r\n\r\nFixes #5378\r\n",
