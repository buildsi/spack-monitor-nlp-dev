    "body": "For some reason bootstrapping cmake on a cray machine with lustre filesystem is laughably slow (8 minutes!)\r\n\r\nTurns out setting -O3 flags for the initial bootstrap itself helps a lot (5 minutes, still 5x slower than my desktop).\r\n\r\nNote that this -O3 is just for the initial tools it compiles to detect system stuff, so it's unrelated to `build_type=Release` (which is used during `make`)\r\n\r\nOn my desktop (amd cpu) the improved runtime is exactly offset by the increased compile time by adding -O3, so no change. \r\n\r\nThanks to https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/10385 for the suggestion!\r\n",
