    "body": "fixes #4573 \r\n\r\nThis PR is a quick fix for #4573. It seems that for some reasons there's a type check within the `update_config` function that permits to reassign objects only if they are instances of `list`. Here I work around the issue modifying the minimum number of lines possible.\r\n\r\nI plan having a closer look at the `spack.config` module in the near future and see if I can propose an improvement of the API.\r\n\r\n@pramodk ",
