The workaround is to create spec lists for compiler and target:\r\n```yaml\r\n  definitions:\r\n  - compilers: ['%gcc@7.5.0']\r\n  - arch: ['arch=linux-centos7-x86_64']\r\n  - pkgs: [libiconv@1.16]\r\n  specs:\r\n    - matrix:\r\n      - [\\$pkgs]\r\n      - [\\$compilers]\r\n      - [\\$arch]\r\n```\r\nShould I then forget about setting compiler and target in `spack: packages: all` section?\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
