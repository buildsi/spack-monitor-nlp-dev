    "body": "fixes #4236\r\nfixes #5002\r\n\r\nThis should be the quickest fix for the two issues listed above. I didn't follow the suggestion in #4307 because `RepoPath` is supposed to provide the same API as `Repo`. Turning:\r\n```python\r\ndef dirname_for_package_name(self, pkg_name):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\ninto:\r\n```python\r\ndef dirname_for_package(self, pkg):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\nwill break this consistency. The function `Repo.dirname_for_package` is used by `filename_for_package` in contexts where the package doesn't exist and we want to know what would be the name for it, like:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack create <url>\r\n```\r\nso it can't be deleted altogether. Refactoring this part will require maybe more discussion, hence the minimal fix.",
