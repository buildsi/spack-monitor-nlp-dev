    "body": "Hi all,\r\n\r\nThere is an issue with spack where if I input the command `spack install dealii ^trilinos@12.8.1` the command fails by saying `Dealii does not depend on trilinos`. However, Deal.II is compiled with Trilinos as one of the dependencies which are turned on by default.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if I point explicitly that trilinos should be enabled `spack install dealii+mpi+trilinos ^trilinos@12.8.1`, I don't get the error anymore.\r\n\r\nIs this a bug or a feature? :)\r\n",
