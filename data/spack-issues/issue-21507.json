If the environment variable `F90` is set, the command is imported as it is. For example, if you are using the Fujitsu compiler, the it uses `frt -dumpversion` to try getting the version, but an error will occur because the \"-dumpversion\" option cannot be recognized.\r\n\r\nTherefore, in the process of selecting the command to be used in the process for each compiler, I fixed to compare the command set in `F77` and `F90` and the command specified for each compiler(e.g. `possible_executables = ['gfortran', 'f95']` in gnu.py).\r\n\r\n\r\n",
