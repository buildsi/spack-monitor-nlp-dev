    "body": "The `ssht` package seems to install its header into the wrong location.\r\n\r\nThe `ssht` package uses `cp` to copy header files into the `include` directory of the install location. However, there is also an (unused) `install` target in the `CMakeFile`, which would install the header files into `include/ssht`.\r\n\r\nHow should this be resolved? I assume the long-term goal is to rely on the package's built-in mechanism as much as possible. However, this would be a breaking change. Are there guidelines or mechanisms for handling this?",
