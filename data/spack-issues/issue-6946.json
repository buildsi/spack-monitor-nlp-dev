    "body": "Fix bugs in building VTK 6.1.0:\r\n\r\n* NetCDF C++ bindings detection failures fixed by specifying header directory in `NETCDF_CXX_IN?CLUDE_DIR` and full library path in `NETCDF_CXX_LIBRARY`\r\n\r\n* Makefile bug fixed by disabling garbage collection flags for Objective-C, which have been removed since VTK 6.2.0. XCode 5.1 removed garbage collection for Objective-C binaries, so compiling with garbage collection flags using recent versions of XCode would result in compile-time errors",
