    "body": "closes #10127\r\n\r\nFollowing the request in https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/10127#pullrequestreview-186647721 I started refactoring the logic underneath:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack compiler add\r\n```\r\nThe version in this PR shows much better performance than the version in `develop`. The main modifications are:\r\n\r\n1. `spack.compilers.find_compilers` employs a `multiprocess.pool.ThreadPool` to execute system commands for the detection of compiler versions.\r\n2. A few memoized functions have been introduced to avoid poking the filesystem multiple times for the same results.\r\n\r\nTiming tests will be posted in the discussion below.",
