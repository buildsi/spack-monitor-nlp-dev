    "body": "These are a series of changes that allow py-numpy to work with netlib-lapack on power PC systems.  In the process, I've dug deep into the py-numpy build system and reverse engineered the undocumented environment variables that need to be set in order to get things to link correctly.  Specifically, we need the following:\r\n\r\n1.) py-numpy needs to define setup_dependent_build_environment in case anyone else tries to use py-numpy's distutil to configure fortran\r\n2.) for those codes that DO use fortran, they need to call \"config_fc\" before they call \"build\" and \"install\"\r\n3.) Extra environment variables need to be set when using py-numpy to disable it from detecting the system blas and using it by default.\r\n4.) Depending on the blas, you might need to link in additional libraries.  netlib-lapack is specifically vulnerable to this.\r\n\r\n ",
