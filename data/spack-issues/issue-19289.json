Looking at http://icl.utk.edu/papi/software/view.html?id=275, it appears that the Software Defined Events (SDE) component was only added in @6.0.0.\r\n\r\nI would have expected spack to complain about trying to use +sde on papi versions <6.0.0.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install papi@5.7.0 %gcc@8.4.0 +infiniband+lmsensors+powercap+rapl+sde+shared\r\n```\r\n\r\nresults in an errors like\r\n```console\r\n  >> 109    checking for components to build... find: 'components/sde': No such\r\n             file or directory\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n```console\r\n$> spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel8-ivybridge\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files.
