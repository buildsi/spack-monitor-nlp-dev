Some dependencies have hard-coded\ndependencies where they shouldn't (e.g., hdf5 -> mpi, libxml -> python),\nbut that's a different rabbit hole.\n\n---\n\nAttempts to build Qt in spack have proven difficult on Fedora 23. I think it should probably not require the whole of mesa, llvm, gtk+, and a whole host of other packages by default. Qt does work if you tell it to build the gui and have a Qt installed.\n",
