    "body": "While working on #4483 I noticed that in `llnl.util.filesystem`:\r\n```python\r\ndef find(root, files, recurse=True):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\ntakes root as the first argument and the list of files as the second argument, while:\r\n```python\r\ndef find_headers(headers, root, recurse=False):\r\n    ...\r\n\r\ndef find_libraries(libraries, root, shared=True, recurse=False):\r\n    ...\r\n```\r\ndo the opposite. I think one of the two must be changed for the sake of consistency, as the functions provide basically the same semantic.",
