This adds a new nvhpc compiler class and a nvhpc package.\r\n\r\nThis PR is submitted as \"official\" support from NVIDIA for the HPC SDK in Spack.\r\n\r\nA simple test to verify:\r\n```\r\n$ spack install nvhpc\r\n$ eval $(spack load --sh nvhpc)\r\n$ spack compiler find\r\n==> Added 1 new compiler to /home/smcmillan/.spack/linux/compilers.yaml\r\n\u00a0 \u00a0 nvhpc@20.9\r\n$ spack install netcdf-c%nvhpc ^openmpi%gcc ^m4%gcc\r\n```\r\n\r\nI have verified this is working correctly on Arm, Power, and X86.\r\n\r\nA forthcoming PR will enable multiple packages to build correctly with the HPC SDK, removing the need to use `^openmpi%gcc ^m4%gcc`.  \r\n\r\nThe nvhpc compiler class and package are a clean break from the PGI compiler.  The NVIDIA HPC SDK is more than simply a rebranding of the PGI compiler.  Also I did not want to disrupt any existing builds that use PGI. \r\n\r\nThe HPC SDK also includes CUDA.  A future enhancement would be to add a cuda variant.\r\n\r\nCloses #17930\r\nCloses #18261 \r\nCloses #19139 \r\nCloses #19162\r\n\r\ncc @scheibelp @tgamblin ",
