    "body": "The changes in this pull request simply modify the style checking script to exempt functions defined with the `@when` decorator from redefinition errors.  These changes have been tested on the `scotch` package, which uses this decorator in multiple locations.  In order to accomplish this testing, the `scotch` package has also been updated to conform to Spack's style standards.\n",
