    "body": "Currently when loading modules from the `modules` list for a compiler, Spack ignores any errors, making it harder than necessary to figure out what's wrong when debugging issues like #18606, #10308, #17100 (and possible some others since the module loading is fuzzy and hence different compilers could be picked up). A simple call to `avail` before the load should return a non-empty list of matching available modules.\r\nThis might break a couple of installations where the loading currently fails silently.",
