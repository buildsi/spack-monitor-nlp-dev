A bit of testing showed that the first time an environment is loaded, LD_LIBRARY_PATH is set correctly. If the environment is then deactivated and subsequently re-activated, PATH will be correctly set but LD_LIBRARY_PATH will not be. \r\n\r\n```\r\nspack env activate my_env\r\nspack env deactivate \r\nspack env activate my_env\r\n```\r\n\r\n\n\n### Error message\n\n[01_Initial_Environment.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7518662/01_Initial_Environment.txt)\r\n[02_First_Activation_GOOD.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7518663/02_First_Activation_GOOD.txt)\r\n[03_First_Deactivate_GOOD.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7518664/03_First_Deactivate_GOOD.txt)\r\n[04_Second_Activate_BAD.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7518665/04_Second_Activate_BAD.txt)\r\n[spack.yaml.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/7518675/spack.yaml.txt)\r\n\r\n\n\n### Information on your system\n\n* **Spack:** 0.16.3-5292-c5be548046\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.2\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\r\n\r\nThis is a WSL1 instance running under Windows 10. I have Environment Modules installed in addition to Spack, but the above issue occurs even when all modules are purged.\r\n\r\n\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\n- [X] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output",
