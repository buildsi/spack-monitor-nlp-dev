Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\nThe `texlive` package has been updated to compile stuff instead of downloading pre-compiled TeXLive suite. The problem is that the package is missing at least the `perl-log-log4perl` runtime dependency (I got an error using `latexmk`) and moreover it is also missing `biber`. \r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install texlive\r\n$ latexmk -pdf <file>\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-1912-7d524169a\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.12\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu18.04-skylake_avx512\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\nThe build completes without error, the problem is at runtime\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [ ] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
