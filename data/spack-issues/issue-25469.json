    "body": "Fixes the checksums added in #25259. One of the versions contains a GitHub URL, and `spack checksum` is currently non-deterministic about where it pulls downloads from, so we were getting GitHub checksums mixed in. This PR also deprecates the GitHub-only release so that it can be removed in the future.\r\n\r\nI would love to fix `spack checksum`, but that's easier said than done and I've tried before.\r\n\r\n@iarspider ",
