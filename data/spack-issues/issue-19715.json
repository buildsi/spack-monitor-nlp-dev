    "body": "* Add Hip Support for umpire, chai, and raja\r\n* Create HipPackage base class to support all hip builds and unify hip-specific variants in one place, mimicking the paradigm used for CudaPackage\r\n\r\nCurrently, the +hip variant works for camp, umpire, and raja\r\n\r\nThere is one build issue for chai+hip. We get complaints that the include path \"/opt/rocm/hip/hcc/include\" does not exist on the corona machine. This path is being incorrectly added to the include paths. However, I have determined that this is an issue with BLT rather than spack. In particular, see the offending lines:\r\n\r\nblt/cmake/thirdparty/SetupHIP.cmake:25:set(HIP_RUNTIME_INCLUDE_DIRS \"${HIP_ROOT_DIR}/include;${HIP_ROOT_DIR}/hcc/include\" CACHE STRING \"\")\r\nblt/host-configs/other/hcc.cmake:35:set(ROCM_INCLUDE_PATH \"${ROCM_ROOT_DIR}/hcc/include;${ROCM_ROOT_DIR}/include\"  CACHE PATH \"\")\r\n \r\nA separate pull request will be submitted to the blt team shortly to deal with that issue",
