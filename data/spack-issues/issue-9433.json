    "body": "This PR updates the VisIt package with the following additions:\r\n\r\n- HDF5 is now an option that can be disabled\r\n- SILO is now an option that can be disabled\r\n- Python is now an option that can be disabled\r\n- GUI is now an option that can be disabled\r\n- Can enable \"parallel\" to compile the parallel engine\r\n\r\nThis allows to better select the needed dependencies and in particular to compile just the engine by disabling the gui, hdf5, and silo variants. This is useful when one wants to compile just the libsim in situ visualization interface (i.e. just the engine).",
