    "body": "Since the merging of #28650, `paraview` fails to build with the  IBM XL and Cray CCE compilers.\r\n\r\nThis issue has been [reported upstream to KitWare](https://gitlab.kitware.com/paraview/paraview/-/issues/21223#note_1140786) as a problem with `ninja` + `xl`. Since then we've encountered the same problems with `cce` builds.\r\n\r\nThis PR proposes that we fallback to the old generator ('Unix Makefiles') when building with `xl` and `cce`.\r\n\r\nIncluding @alalazo and @vicentebolea, as they reviewed #28650, and also @EthanS94, as he confirmed the problem with `xl` and reported it to KitWare.\r\n\r\nThanks!",
