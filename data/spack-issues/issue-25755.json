    "body": "This PR partially reverts #23485 as it introduced a performance regression\r\nin `spack env activate`. The test from that PR is still there and passing.\r\n\r\nThe current logic of `spack env activate` is as follows:\r\n\r\n1. collect root specs\r\n2. add root specs + transitive run type deps of root specs to a list\r\n3. call `environment_modifications_for_spec` for every spec of this list\r\n\r\nHowever, `environment_modifications_for_spec` also processes run type\r\ndependencies of the spec, so we're doing a lot of redundant work,\r\nresulting in O(n^2) processed specs given `n` of them in\r\na chain like `a` <- `b` <- ... <- `z`\r\n\r\nThis PR drops step 2, so that we call\r\n`environment_modifications_for_spec` only on the root specs, and this\r\nfunction will process the run type deps for us anyways.\r\n\r\nGiven an environment like this:\r\n\r\n```yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  specs:\r\n  - py-flake8\r\n  - py-matplotlib\r\n  - py-isort\r\n  - py-sphinx\r\n  - py-six\r\n  - py-ipython\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis is the time spent on `activate` before and after:\r\n\r\n**Before**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: from spack.main import SpackCommand\r\nIn [2]: env = SpackCommand('env')\r\nIn [3]: %timeit env('activate', '--sh', '.')\r\n2.56 s \u00b1 11.4 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\r\n```\r\n\r\n**After**:\r\n\r\n```\r\nIn [1]: from spack.main import SpackCommand\r\nIn [2]: env = SpackCommand('env')\r\nIn [3]: %timeit env('activate', '--sh', '.')\r\n820 ms \u00b1 6.22 ms per loop (mean \u00b1 std. dev. of 7 runs, 1 loop each)\r\n```\r\n\r\nwhich is 68% less.\r\n\r\nThe diff of `spack env activate --sh .` is the same except for the order of paths in `PYTHONPATH`, but note that the logic introduced in #23485 didn't walk over the deps in post order: `root_spec.traverse(deptype='run', root=True)` which seems to be a mistake? (@scheibelp). Anyways, that's gone with this pr.\r\n",
