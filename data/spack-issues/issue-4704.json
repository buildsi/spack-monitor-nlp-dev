    "body": "A couple of packages add target like `CFLAGS=foo`, CC=`bar`, which is a bit hackish. With the new `make_args()`, this can be done much cleaner.\r\n\r\nI rewrote `libxsmm` as an example.\r\n\r\nWith this in place, half of the Makefile edits could be dropped and replaced by `make CC=..`, which is much less brittle than patching.",
