    "body": "fixes #19966\r\n\r\nModifications to the recipe:\r\n - [x] Global arrays supports GCC 10 since version 5.7.1, therefore a conflict has been added to avoid old releases to error at build-time.\r\n- [x] Removed the `blas` and `lapack` variant since BLAS and LAPACK are always a dependency and, if not specified during configure, a version of these APIs vendored with Global Arrays is built.\r\n- [x] Fixed a few options in configuration to locate BLAS, LAPACK and SCALAPACK correctly.\r\n- [x] Build shared libraries too.",
