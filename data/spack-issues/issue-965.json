    "body": "Currently in a straw man state, I wouldn't yet merge this. The feature I want:\n\n``` bash\nspack repo add https://www.github.com/DavidPoliakoff/some_package_repository.git\n```\n\nTo download the given github package and add it as a repo (this will be useful for site-local collections of spack packages)\n\nSome questions remain:\n- How do we get the fetch strategy from the url (in fetch_strategy.py, the function from_url, currently a straw man)?\n- Where do we want these repositories to live? Right now I have them being stored in a package underneath the main repo, but could as easily see them living at the same level as the builtin collection of packages.\n\nThoughts? This is as much an issue with a strawman attached as a PR.\n",
