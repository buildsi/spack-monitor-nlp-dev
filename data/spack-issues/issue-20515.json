    "body": "It's a bit surprising that GCC is built with ISL: this is not enabled by default upstream, and most toolchains I know (Debian, OpenWrt) don't enable it.\r\n\r\nIn addition, compatibility is rather picky, as evidenced by the many version constraints in the current package and by upstream bug reports: https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=graphite\r\n\r\nIt would make more sense to use ISL only as an optional dependency. When the option is disabled, the following is needed to make sure graphite is not used:\r\n```\r\n--without-isl --without-cloog\r\n```\r\n",
