This includes NAG.\r\n\r\n`verbose_flag()` is not implemented for the NAG compiler in Spack. It is possible that `-V` is the appropriate choice for this. Since link-path detection logic involves compiling a C file, I'm not sure if it should be run at all if the available exe is meant for compiling Fortran.",
