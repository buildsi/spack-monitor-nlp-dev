    "body": "Given the discussion in #1325, it seems like everyone needs to completely reinstall Spack every time the hashing algorithm changes. It would be useful if Spack had a command to reinstall an entire database of software, or at least a log showing what was installed and how.\r\n\r\nThis could either reinstall the exact spec (which may change from time to time), a spec close enough that the same packages and versions would be installed (useful if you use modules), or run the same commands that were used to install the software (which may not be very specific).",
