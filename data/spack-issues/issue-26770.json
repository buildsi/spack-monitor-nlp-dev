    "body": "Hello,\r\n\r\nCould you tell me how to set up a Spack smoke test (or stand-alone) for a header-only library?\r\n\r\nI'm trying to implement a smoke test in the [Metall package](https://github.com/spack/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/metall/package.py) (founded by the Exascale Computing Project).\r\n\r\nI read [this](https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#stand-alone-or-smoke-tests) section on Spack's Read the Docs, but I have some questions.\r\n\r\n**Executables:**\r\nAs Metall is a C++ header-only library, we don't generate any executables during the installation unless users turn on the build-test option (Metall already supports a Spack build-time test).\r\n\r\nI found a sentence that says `run_test` method builds executable. But, I don't quite understand how to use it to build an executable:\r\nhttps://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/packaging_guide.html#reading-expected-output-from-a-file\r\n\r\n**Compiler:**\r\nIs it possible to install a proper version of a compiler before running a smoke test?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\nKeita",
