    "body": "On OS X (El Capitan), Spack does not auto-detect the default system compiler `/usr/bin/cc`. It should probably generate a configuration entry like this:\n\n``` yaml\n    clang@apple-7.0.2:\n      cc: /usr/bin/cc\n      cxx: /usr/bin/c++\n      f77: None\n      fc: None\n```\n\nNote that Apple uses their own, non-standard version numbers. The compiler describes itself like this:\n\n```\n$ /usr/bin/cc --version\nApple LLVM version 7.0.2 (clang-700.1.81)\nTarget: x86_64-apple-darwin15.2.0\nThread model: posix\n```\n\nSpack does detect the very outdated gcc version that is also available as `/usr/bin/gcc`; this version is so old (4.2.1) that I cannot recommend using it for anything.\n",
