    "body": "I'm getting this stack trace when I try and run `bin/spack -vd install hoomd-blue@2.0.3~doc%gcc@4.9.3 arch=cray-CNL-istanbul`\n\n```\n  File \"/autofs/nccs-svm1_home2/wyn/spack/lib/spack/spack/provider_index.py\", line 235, in merge\n    spdict[provided_spec] += opdict[provided_spec]\nTypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'set' and 'set'\n```\n\nI'm not 100% sure on what's triggering that since it worked last week, but when I cloned a fresh copy of spack, it caused this issue. Since it's an operation on two sets, I tried to change the line to `spdict[provided_spec] = spdict[provided_spec].union(opdict[provided_spec])` And it seems to not fail out at that point anymore. Could someone more familiar with spack's internals make sure that was the correct fix?\n",
