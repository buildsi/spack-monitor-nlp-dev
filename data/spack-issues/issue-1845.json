    "body": "When I try to build CMake (spec: `cmake@3.6.1%gcc@4.3.4 arch=linux-SuSE11-x86_64 ~doc+ncurses+openssl+ownlibs~qt`) with any commit since 2a823fb (meaning this commit is the last one that works) spack will fail with `NameError: global name 'dso_suffix' is not defined`. I noticed that dso_suffix is defined at the top of lib/spack/spack/build_environment.py and is referenced in (and failing at) line 57 of lib/spack/spack/abi.py. If I add `from build_environment import dso_suffix` to abi.py it seems to fix the issue. I'll open a PR if this is an appropriate fix.\n",
