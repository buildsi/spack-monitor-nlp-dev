    "body": "I just found that in order to build a package I needed to change the `ldflags`, adding the `-w` flag in order to silence warnings (because the package is so strict that will stop with an error if any warning is issued).\r\n\r\nHowever, by doing that (just adding the `-w` to silence warnings), the hashes for installed packages changed, and I ended up having duplicated packages because dependencies were built again.\r\n\r\nIs there any way of applying such slight changes to compiler flags without ending up with duplicated packages for dependencies because of new hashes?\r\n\r\nThanks!!",
