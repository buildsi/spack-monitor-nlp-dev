    "body": "We wrap our ifx compiler, such that the original binary is renamed ifx_orig. This causes the `ifx --version` command to produce:\r\n\r\n$ ifx --version\r\nifx_orig (IFORT) 2021.1 Beta 20201113\r\nCopyright (C) 1985-2020 Intel Corporation. All rights reserved.\r\n\r\nThe regex for ifx currently expects the output to begin with \"ifx (IFORT)...\" I think in general, the Intel compiler regexes do not include the invoked executable name (i.e., ifort, icc, icx, etc.), so I think this PR would make ifx more consistent in that sense.",
