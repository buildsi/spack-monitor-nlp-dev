    "body": "I reported the issues on the ELPA page (https://github.com/marekandreas/elpa/issues/7). The problem is that ./configure script tries to execute MPI test, which is not possible on most HPC platforms (if you don't build on a compute node). The current fix is to add `--without-threading-support-check-during-build` flag to the configure options. IMO threading support in MPI should be assumed by default in the 21-st century. ",
