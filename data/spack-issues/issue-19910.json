    "body": "Previously, if bzip2 was installed as an external package whose prefix\r\nis `/`, then the bzip2 would find all sorts of undesirable copies of\r\nbzip installed by flatpak, anaconda, and others.  This makes the search\r\ndirectories much more conservative to avoid that change.\r\n\r\nSee also: https://spackpm.slack.com/archives/C5W7NKZJT/p1604598268233500\r\n\r\n@becker33 I didn't see a PR for this, so I went ahead and created one.  Thanks for helping me debug and fix this one.",
