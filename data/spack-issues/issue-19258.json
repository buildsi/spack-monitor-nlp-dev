    "body": "closes #18582\r\n\r\nThis commit refactors the computation of the search path for aclocal in its own method, so that it's easier to reuse for packages that need to have a custom autoreconf phase. It's an alternative to #18582 that doesn't duplicate the way we pass this information to autotools. \r\n\r\nThe difference between using ACLOCAL_PATH and the `-I` option is that the latter takes precedence over the former, so if we adopt this PR we'll still be using the \"most authorative\" way of extending the search path.",
