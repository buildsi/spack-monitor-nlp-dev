    "body": "On macOS, the build of libxxhash is performed by a bare `make` launched by `MakePackage`s default `build` phase. As `prefix` is not set in `xxhash`'s `Makefile` at this point, the library gets compiled with a hard-coded install name of `/usr/local/libxxhash.dylib`. Downstream clients, in the tested case Root, will then fail to build as the install name is incorrect.\r\n\r\nMove setting of `prefix` from `install` to `edit` so that it propagates to subsequent `build` and `install` phases.\r\n",
