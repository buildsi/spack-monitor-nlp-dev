    "body": "This branch enables the detection of various IBM XL compilers. It associates the fortran compiler to the proper version of the C/C++ compiler. The major version of the fortran compiler is always the major version of the C/C++ compiler plus 2 for a matching release. Minor versions are also tricky. It is important to associate C/C++ and fortran compiler of the same version as they share runtime components.\n\nAn installation of xlc-11.1/xlf-13.1 will all come under xl-11.1.\n",
