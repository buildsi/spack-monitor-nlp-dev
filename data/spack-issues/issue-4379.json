    "body": "untill `spack setup` is fixed, do you guys think it's possible to make the logging of `Cmake` configure command for a package copy-pastable? What i mean is the following. Currently, logs looks like\r\n```\r\n==> 'cmake' 'path/to/prefix' '-DNETCDF_LIBRARIES=path/to/spack/darwin-sierra-x86_64/clang-8.1.0-apple/netcdf-cxx-4.2-lufryppgipbc7i4el5pyongmmfrbuspk/lib/libnetcdf_c++.dylib;path/to/spack/opt/spack/darwin-sierra-x86_64/clang-8.1.0-apple/netcdf-4.4.1.1-tybgpm73o522k2z46w5sevpowfbgjhk5/lib/libnetcdf.dylib'\r\n```\r\nso direct copy-paste won't do. Also removing those `'` symbols won't help either as what one actually have to do is\r\n```\r\ncmake path/to/prefix -DNETCDF_LIBRARIES=\"path/to/spack/darwin-sierra-x86_64/clang-8.1.0-apple/netcdf-cxx-4.2-lufryppgipbc7i4el5pyongmmfrbuspk/lib/libnetcdf_c++.dylib;path/to/spack/opt/spack/darwin-sierra-x86_64/clang-8.1.0-apple/netcdf-4.4.1.1-tybgpm73o522k2z46w5sevpowfbgjhk5/lib/libnetcdf.dylib\"\r\n```\r\n(note the double quotes).\r\n\r\nOne could, of course, write a python script to transform the original logged output to the desired one, but if the same can be achieved by a minor tweaking of the logging in Spack, that could be useful for developers in combination with `spack env` command.",
