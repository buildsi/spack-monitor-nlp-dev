    "body": "Previously, namespace was set to None.  This prevented proper comparison between Specs, causing the user's directives in `packages.yaml` to be ignored at times.\n\nThis PR needs a bit more thinking.  We should probably allow the user to specify a namespace in `packages.yaml`, rather than always hardcoding to 'builtin'.  However, in existing practice, 'builtin' is the only Spack repo that people seem to use.\n\nThis addresses #1622 \n",
