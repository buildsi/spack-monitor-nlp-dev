    "body": "### Summary\n\nEnvironment views currently use absolute links to the actual view directory, e.g. a view at `/usr/local` will make that an absolute link to `/usr/._local/xmtuqjhjio3cw53twomkg2gzcg626zbp`. This feature request propose to change this to a relative link to `._local/xmtuqjhjio3cw53twomkg2gzcg626zbp` instead.\n\n### Rationale\n\n The absolute link works fine inside the system itself, but when a file system is exposed at an external location (for example as a singularity sandbox image on a global networked file system like `/cvmfs`) this leads to broken links. The broken links lead to confusion navigating these directories from outside the system.\n\n### Description\n\nAn alternative solution is to use copy views instead of links, as suggested in slack by @psakievich and in reference to https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/25891.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
