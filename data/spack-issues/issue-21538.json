Add the test which uses `spack buildcache create` from #19085.\r\n\r\nThe PR has been split into several independent commits, with all of the work below in the final commit:\r\n\r\n2. Make `spack buildcache list` use the directory `~/.spack/caches/indices` (using `config:misc_cache` as the root) to persist the `BinaryCacheIndex`.\r\n2. Create `spec_index.py`:\r\n    1. Move `InstallRecord` from `database.py`.\r\n    1. Create `IndexQuery` class which performs the logic of `Database._query()`.\r\n    1. Create a singleton `SpecIndex` to expose only local, only remote, or both local and remote specs for querying.\r\n2. Make `spack spec`, `spack find`, and `spack install` concretize specs by referring to the appropriate `SpecIndex` instance.\r\n\r\n### Result\r\nThe following works:\r\n```bash\r\n> spack buildcache list -l  # note hash for desired package is abcdefg \r\n> spack install /abcdefg    # if /abcdefg is from a remote buildcache\r\n```",
