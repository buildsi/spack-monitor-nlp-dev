    "body": "@hainest, I report here a couple of issues that @eschnett addressed trying to build boost on macOS.\r\n\r\n- boost filesystem incompatibility with GCC (on darwin?)\r\nhttps://github.com/boostorg/filesystem/issues/199\r\n- boost in spack uses an incomplete tree (is it needed to run `b2 headers`?)\r\nhttps://github.com/boostorg/property_map/issues/22\r\n\r\nThe above issues refers to develop branch of Boost (it was indicatively `boost-1.77.0.beta1` at the time of test), so they should affect also the next 1.77.0 release.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nVery well detailed reports can be found in the issues above (thanks @eschnett)\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n@eschnett can you please report your `spack debug report` in the comments?\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files (in the issues linked)\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
