I can run \"spack find\" as root on a node though the above error happens when ran as another non-root user.\r\n\r\nRoot owned everything before pulling the latest changes from git so I wanted to make sure that the problem isn't the permissions I have in place.\r\n\r\n```\r\n[root@node103 spack]# spack find | head\r\n-- linux-rhel6-x86_64 / gcc@4.4.6 -------------------------------\r\nautoconf@2.69\r\nautomake@1.15\r\nbamtools@2.4.1\r\nbcftools@1.4\r\nbedtools2@2.26.0\r\nbinutils@2.28\r\nbinutils@2.28\r\nbison@3.0.4\r\nboost@1.63.0\r\n\r\n[root@node103 spack]# ls -ltr /pbtech_mounts/softlib001/apps/EL6/spack/opt/spack/.spack-db\r\ntotal 160\r\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     27 Apr 28 15:33 prefix_lock\r\n-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 153869 Apr 28 15:44 index.json\r\n-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root     27 May  4 08:20 lock\r\n```",
