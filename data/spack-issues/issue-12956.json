    "body": "This creates a new flag `--no-deps` for `spack buildcache create` which allows users to cache specs *without* their dependencies. This is useful when a package requires a rebuild but its dependencies do not require rebuild. In such a case, particularly with respect to build pipeline usage, newly rebuilt packages need to be re-cached without the overhead of re-caching dependencies which are already up to date in the build cache. Without this option, `spack buildcache create` caches not only the newly rebuilt package but also all of their dependencies.",
