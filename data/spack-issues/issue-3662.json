    "body": "I found a problem when installing subversion without the variant `+perl`. For some reason, the expression `spec.satisfies('^swig')` in the subversion package.py evaluates to True even when swig is not in the spec. This causes an error when `spec['swig'].prefix` is evaluated. Replacing the expression by `'swig' in spec` worked as expected, so I also replaced a similar expression involving perl.",
