    "body": "`spack config blame` does not report the correct file for some settings. This may only be the case when merging lists from multiple scopes.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack config blame packages\r\n...\r\n/Users/Adam/spack/etc/spack/defaults/packages.yaml:18             compiler: [apple-clang, clang, gcc, intel, pgi, xl, nag, fj, aocc]\r\n...\r\n```\r\nAs you can see, the default compiler on macOS is `%apple-clang`, but this setting actually comes from `etc/spack/defaults/darwin/packages.yaml`, not `etc/spack/defaults/packages.yaml`.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.15.4-1861-1e35faa932\r\n* **Python:** 3.8.2\r\n* **Platform:** darwin-catalina-ivybridge\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [ ] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\n@tgamblin @scheibelp @becker33 ",
