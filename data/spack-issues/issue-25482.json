    "body": "- Added new checksums for 4.3.\r\n- Now using llvm-amdgpu ~openmp in order to use the rocm-device-libs\r\n  build as external project in llvm-amdgpu package. We still need\r\n  to pull device-libs in using resource for the build as some headers\r\n  are not installed.\r\n- Updated symlink creation to now remove an existing link if  present\r\n  to avoid issues on partial reinstalls when debugging.\r\n- Adjusted the flang_warning to be a part of Cmake options instead of\r\n  a filter_file for better compatability.\r\n- The dependency on hsa-rocr-dev created some problems as type was changed\r\n  to the default build/link. This issue was because ROCr uses libelf and\r\n  the build of openmp expects elfutils. When link is specified libelf\r\n  was being found in the path first, causing errors. This was\r\n  introduced with the llvm-amdgpu external project build of device-libs.\r\n- On a bare bone installation of sles15 it was noted that libquadmath0 was\r\n  needed as a dependency. On 18.04 gcc-multilib was also needed.",
