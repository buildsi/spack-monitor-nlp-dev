    "body": "subj. Roughly that `+shared` enables shared libs, whereas `~shared` implies that static-only libs will be built. \r\n\r\nMost likely we cant really enforce `+shared` not to have static libs, as some packages may build them anyway.\r\n\r\nfrom @alalazo \r\n\r\n> What all the other packages do is to build both shared and static libraries when +shared and just static when ~shared.\r\n\r\nWhile here, also document `+pic` variant for static libs only and that `+pic+shared` should throw an error.",
