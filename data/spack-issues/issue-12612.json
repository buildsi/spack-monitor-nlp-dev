    "body": "When a package is installed in a Spack environment it is added to the repo contained in the environment directory. However, the patches for the packages are not written to the repo package directory which makes the repo not usable for rebuilding anything that had patches.\r\n\r\nFor example, here is the default package directory for julia:\r\n```console\r\nls var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/julia/\r\ngc.patch  openblas.patch  package.py  __pycache__\r\n```\r\nAnd here is the directory in the environment repo:\r\n```console\r\nls ../spack-configs/argon/2019.1/environments/python2_gcc_packages/.spack-env/repos/builtin/packages/julia/\r\npackage.py\r\n```\r\nI am using an environment directory in case that might be important.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\nThis includes:\r\n\r\n 1. CentOS-7\r\n 2. current develop branch as of August 27, 2019",
