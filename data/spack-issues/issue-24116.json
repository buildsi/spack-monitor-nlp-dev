    "body": "I build a rather large stack of Python packages. They all depend on Python, which depends on uuid. `apple-libuuid` is an external package that comes pre-installed on macOS. When I build my environment, I see hundreds of lines like:\r\n```\r\n==> Warning: Missing a source id for apple-libuuid@1353.100.2\r\n==> Warning: Missing a source id for apple-libuuid@1353.100.2\r\n==> Warning: Missing a source id for apple-libuuid@1353.100.2\r\n```\r\nFor Spack-built packages, this is a good warning to have, because it warns you that Spack will ask if you're sure you want to fetch without a checksum. But for external packages, this warning is meaningless. We should silence this warning.",
