    "body": "After we have now 3 open issues due to merge conflicts in `spack view`, I added a note to the existence of the `-i` (ignore conflicts) option in case of an error.\r\n\r\nI'm not sure if I should intercept the error and update the error message or if this should directly be part of the original error message. This is the least invasive solution, nothing more.\r\n\r\nRelates to #9029, #7001, #6266 ",
