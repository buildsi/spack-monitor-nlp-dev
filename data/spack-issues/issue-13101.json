But now it's more serious\r\nbecause it's harder to avoid python3.  I noticed this with papi, but\r\nthere are other packages that use `filter_file`.\r\n\r\nI normally include this in `packages.yaml`, but it fails both with and\r\nwithout this.\r\n\r\n```\r\npackages:\r\n  python:\r\n    paths:\r\n      python@2.7.15:  /usr\r\n    buildable: False\r\n```\r\n\r\nI don't really know a satisfactory workaround, except to revert to the\r\nlast working commit or else hack `packages.py` to remove `filter_file`.\r\n\r\nping @tgamblin and @alalazo ",
