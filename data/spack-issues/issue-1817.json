I'm trying to build intltool, but am running into the following problem:\n\n```\nchecking for perl... /usr/bin/perl\nchecking for perl >= 5.8.1... 5.22.2\nchecking for XML::Parser... configure: error: XML::Parser perl module is required for intltool\n```\n\nNot only does intltool not declare its dependency on Perl, but there's no way to declare it's dependency on the Perl XML Parser module.\n",
