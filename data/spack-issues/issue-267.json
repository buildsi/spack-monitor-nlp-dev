    "body": "We can get a conflict when trying to install a package that has dependencies that themselves depend on different variants of a dependent package. For instance:\n\n[lee218@hype2:spack]$ spack -v install py-basemap\n==> Error: Invalid spec: 'libxml2@2.9.2%gcc@4.8.5~python=chaos_6_x86_64_ib^xz@5.2.2%gcc@4.8.5=chaos_6_x86_64_ib^zlib@1.2.8%gcc@4.8.5=chaos_6_x86_64_ib'. Package libxml2 requires variant +python, but spec asked for ~python\n\nThe underlying problem is that the mesa package requests libxml2+python, while qt and fontconfig just request libxml2. I can work around this by explicitly requesting \"py-basemap^libxml2+python\".\n",
