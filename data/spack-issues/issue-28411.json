    "body": "Reverts #28003\r\nReverts #28360\r\n\r\n@scheibelp and @varioustoxins have volunteered to maintain Python 2 support for me, so I'm fine with reverting this change. I will still deprecate Python 3.1 though since #28346 requires sysconfig which was introduced in 2.7/3.2. I may consider deprecating additional versions of Python 3.2-3.6 in the future if these versions become difficult to maintain. Unlike the change from Python 2 to 3, the change from 3.6 to 3.7 usually just involves deleting pre-cythonized files.",
