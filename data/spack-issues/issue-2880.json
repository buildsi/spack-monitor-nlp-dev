    "body": "This is likely to be a more controversial change; please see it more as a discussion starter.\r\n\r\nThe current shell integration script calls `spack-python` three times, which takes quite some time on our cluster (2-3s). Since the shell integration is loaded for every login, this can be quite annoying.\r\n\r\nThe change cuts down the amount of invocations to one for installations using the default dotkit and modules paths. On our cluster, this shortens the time needed to 0.7-0.8s.",
