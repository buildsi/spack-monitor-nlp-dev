    "body": "In the repository, change `<package-name>/package.py` to `<package-name>/<package-name>.py`\n\nWhy?  Because the current scheme, where everything is called \"package.py\" doesn't work with standard tools.  For example:\n ^x^b in Emacs shows a sea of package.py.  You can't change from one to the other easily with ^xb\n You can't search for package.py (in a meaningful way) in SpartGit.\n\nI'm sure the list goes on...\n",
