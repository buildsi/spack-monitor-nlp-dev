    "body": "### Summary\n\nWe should allow conditional dependencies in `spack.yaml` files.\n\n### Rationale\n\n`spack.yaml` is designed to describe the dependencies of a project. Many of these dependencies are conditional on OS or dependency version. Other package managers like conda and pip support this like so:\r\n```\r\nwincertstore; sys_platform == 'win32'\r\nenum34; python_version < '3.4'\r\n```\r\nMany of these dependencies either can't be installed or aren't needed for some platforms/versions.\r\n\r\nSpack also supports this in a `package.py` with the `when=` arg to `depends_on`.\n\n### Description\n\nWe could do something like:\r\n```yaml\r\nspack:\r\n  specs:\r\n  - py-h5py\r\n  - py-wincertstore:\r\n      when: platform=win32\r\n  - py-enum34:\r\n      when: ^python@:3.3\r\n```\r\nI believe this is valid YAML syntax and fairly intuitive. I'm open to other suggestions.\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
