    "body": "These commits add the `blas_libs`, `lapack_libs`, and `headers` properties to `openblas`.\r\n\r\nI was running into some issues configuring `hypre`, and one of the errors I encountered was that `hypre`'s `configure` script could not find `lapack`. Adding the `lapack_libs` method fixed the error, and I added the `blas_libs` and `headers` methods for consistency with `netlib-lapack`.",
