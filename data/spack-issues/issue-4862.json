    "body": "This change was requested by @ax3l in https://github.com/LLNL/spack/pull/4846#issuecomment-317069670.\r\n\r\nWhen you use `spack create` to create a new package, Spack looks at the contents of the tarball to decide what build system it uses. If it contains a `configure` script, we assume it uses Autotools. If it contains a `CMakeLists.txt`, we assume it uses CMake.\r\n\r\nPreviously, if the tarball contained both files (presumably supporting both build systems) we chose Autotools by default. With this change, CMake becomes chosen instead. Let me know if there are any other build systems we should reorder.",
