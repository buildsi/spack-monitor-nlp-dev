    "body": "If you run `spack install` on a package that downloads a .zip archive, the decompression stage spits out thousands of lines of text like:\r\n```\r\ninflating: sys/java/jre/glnxa64/jre/lib/security/cacerts  \r\n```\r\nYou can suppress this output by using `unzip -q` or `unzip -qq` if you want it to be really quiet. I tried adding this to `spack.util.compression.decompressor_for`, but `which()` can't accept a second argument. Can someone else figure this out? We should probably also add it to `spack create`, which is much easier.\r\n\r\nHere are a list of packages for testing:\r\n\r\n- bliss\r\n- bowtie2\r\n- cryptopp\r\n- docbook-xml\r\n- exodusii\r\n- jasper\r\n- py-3to2\r\n- triangle\r\n- ncl\r\n- openscenegraph\r\n- py-pydatalog",
