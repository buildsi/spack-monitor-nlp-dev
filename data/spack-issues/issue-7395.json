    "body": "It appears that `spack install openmpi@3.0.0 schedulers=slurm fabrics=pmi` installs with verbs instead of the specified pmi fabric. When I look at the resulting build.out, I can see the configure arguments contain \"--with-verbs --without-pmi\". If I delete the \"default=\" line from OpenMPI's package.py, the build.out correctly shows \"--without-verbs --with-pmi\"",
