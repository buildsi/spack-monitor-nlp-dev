    "body": "This introduces the newest version for libdrm, 2.4.107. The version 2.4.100 was having trouble building with clang-14.\r\n\r\nThe previously most recent version was the last one based on autotools. This PR therefore also adds support for the newer meson build system while maintaining support for the older versions. The inspiration for the approach came from the glib package.\r\n\r\nThere are no meson arguments needed, but because the package does not inherit from MesonPackage we still have to define it.\r\n\r\nThe previous autotools arguments do not seem necessary. I hope the additional compilation tests on the CI nodes may point out issues on platforms I have no access to for testing.",
