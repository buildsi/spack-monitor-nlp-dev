    "body": "There are multiple places inside /lib/spack/spack/relocate.py where strings and bytes are concatenated, which is not allowed in Python 3. For instance, if you try to install a package from binary cache (`spack buildcache install <spec-available-at-buildcache>`), using Spack+Py3, the process fails with an error from line 323 of lib/spack/spack/relocate.py complaining about this. There are at least a few other places in that file which cause problems during installation from binary cache with python3.",
