    "body": "### Steps to reproduce\r\n\r\nI'm trying to use the overriding of packages as described in https://spack.readthedocs.io/en/latest/repositories.html#overriding-built-in-packages, with the following setup:\r\n- the builtin repo contains a package with the most recent versions (e.g. zlib 1.2.11)\r\n- a local repo contains the same package but only an old version (e.g. zlib 1.2.8)\r\n\r\nlocalrepo is added to the repo list, thus it has priority over builtin. Since I want the latest version of the package, I run `spack install builtin.zlib@1.2.11`, but it does not behave as expected with v0.17.0 and v0.17.1, while it's ok with v0.16.3\r\n\r\n\r\n### Error message\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install builtin.zlib@1.2.11\r\n==> Warning: Missing a source id for zlib@1.2.11\r\n==> Installing zlib-1.2.11-ysprwfsnfe2ybpqg4r3tkbkvyavgmjne\r\n==> No binary for zlib-1.2.11-ysprwfsnfe2ybpqg4r3tkbkvyavgmjne found: installing from source\r\n==> Warning: There is no checksum on file to fetch zlib@1.2.11 safely.\r\n==>   Fetch anyway?
