    "body": "So far, I've used Spack just by myself.  Now, I wanted to share a Spack installation between two people.\n\nI began with a `chmod -R a+r spack`.  This allowed others to read the repo.  However, `spack setup` didn't work for the other user, because it tries to write.  This is an unanticipated downside of the `spack setup` way of doing things...\n\nI then did `chmod -R a+w spack`.  That made `spack setup` work, which produced the `spconfig.py` file I needed.  But building packages with Spack still did not work for the other user: apparently, `os.chmod()` is involved inside of Spack, and that failed if you're not the owner.\n\nOverall, I would say we need to think through multi-user use cases and how to support them with Spack.\n",
