    "body": "Despite the name, `spack mirror create` and `spack buildcache create` used to also accept mirror URLs and the names of configured mirrors passed via the `-d, --directory` argument.  To minimize confusion, this behavior was changed so that only `file://` URLs would be accepted.  The `-m, --mirror-name` and `--mirror-url` arguments were added to `spack buildcache create` to allow users to specify remote mirrors, but `spack mirror create` lacks these additions.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack buildcache create --help\r\nusage: spack buildcache create [-hrfua] [-k key]\r\n                               (-d directory | -m mirror-name | --mirror-url mirror-url)\r\n                               [--rebuild-index] [-y SPEC_YAML]\r\n                               [--only {package,dependencies}]\r\n                               ...\r\n\r\npositional arguments:\r\n  specs                 one or more package specs\r\n\r\noptional arguments:\r\n  -h, --help            show this help message and exit\r\n  -r, --rel             make all rpaths relative before creating tarballs.\r\n  -f, --force           overwrite tarball if it exists.\r\n  -u, --unsigned        create unsigned buildcache tarballs for testing\r\n  -a, --allow-root      allow install root string in binary files after RPATH substitution\r\n  -k key, --key key     Key for signing.\r\n  -d directory, --directory directory\r\n                        local directory where buildcaches will be written.\r\n  -m mirror-name, --mirror-name mirror-name\r\n                        name of the mirror where buildcaches will be written.\r\n  --mirror-url mirror-url\r\n                        URL of the mirror where buildcaches will be written.\r\n  --rebuild-index       Regenerate buildcache index after building package(s)\r\n  -y SPEC_YAML, --spec-yaml SPEC_YAML\r\n                        Create buildcache entry for spec from yaml file\r\n  --only {package,dependencies}\r\n                        Select the buildcache mode. the default is to build a cache for the package along with all its dependencies.
