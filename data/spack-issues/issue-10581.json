    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nI manually modified the petsc/package.py to depend on python >= 3.4.\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install petsc\r\n... # ImportError: No module named site.\r\n```\r\nThe problem is the last official release of PETsc does not support Python3.\r\n\r\nHowever, a Python3 compatible version of PETsc will be released soon.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, the current master branch of PETsc is Python3 compatible.\r\n\r\nSo, right or wrong, good practice or not, I downloaded a ZIP archive of the current PETsc git repo and used that as a repeatible, checksummable archive. \r\n\r\nThis unofficial petsc archive installed fine with Python-3.7.2. \r\n",
