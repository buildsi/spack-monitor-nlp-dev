    "body": "reuses part of #20207 (there's an edited commit where I maintained only the bootstrapping of clingo from the original PR)\r\n\r\nThis PR adds a few bits on top of the PRs above to enable bootstrapping clingo from sources. During the bootstrapping phase Spack takes ownership of the configuration by temporarily overriding:\r\n- The repository being used\r\n- The store being used to install the software\r\n- The configuration and platform being used\r\n\r\nThe same mechanism is applied to bootstrap clingo in CI jobs, so that now clingo is tested on all the relevant Python versions on linux. To minimize the software being built we look before starting unit tests for external `cmake` and `bison`. Documented briefly how to trigger bootstrapping from sources.\r\n\r\nThe software bootstrapped by Spack is installed in `${HOME}/.spack`.",
