    "body": "A Spack hack for MKL usage was needed in QMCPACK prior to version 3.5 when non-Intel compilers were used. This Spack hack could have undesirable side-effects and led to ugly code that was extra work to maintain. For older version of QMCPACK, we through a conflict if you want to use Intel MKL with the other compilers commonly found on x86.\r\n\r\nNote that there is no impact to version of QMCPACK since 3.5.",
