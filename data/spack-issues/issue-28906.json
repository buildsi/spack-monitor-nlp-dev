[This ticket on GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=100379) suggests the includes for cyclades.h can be simply removed and perhaps a spack patch may help resolve this issue. It looks like https://github.com/ROCm-Developer-Tools/llvm-project hasn't had any major activity for some time, so a patch may be the only route forward unless the llvm-project sees an update.\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\n- [X] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and **@mentioned** any maintainers\n- [X] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
