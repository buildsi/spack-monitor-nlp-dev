    "body": "Hi there,\r\n\r\n\r\nI have installed spack on the login node of our cluster. It was working fine. However, after and NFS remount of the home directories where the user have their data (including mine) spack hangs. For instance\r\n\r\n source share/spack/setup-env.sh\r\n-bash-4.2$ spack --debug find\r\n==> [2020-07-10-14:43:38.701278, 25090] Imported find from built-in commands\r\n==> [2020-07-10-14:43:38.702756, 25090] Imported find from built-in commands\r\n==> [2020-07-10-14:43:38.703585, 25090] Reading config file /mnt/maths/rs558/spa                   ck/etc/spack/defaults/config.yaml\r\n==> [2020-07-10-14:43:38.729605, 25090] DATABASE LOCK TIMEOUT: 3s\r\n==> [2020-07-10-14:43:38.729749, 25090] PACKAGE LOCK TIMEOUT: No timeout\r\n==> [2020-07-10-14:43:38.730461, 25090] READ LOCK (database): /mnt/maths/rs558/s                   pack/opt/spack/.spack-db/lock[0:0] [Acquiring]\r\n==> [2020-07-10-14:43:38.731264, 25090] read locking [0:0]: timeout 3 sec\r\n\r\n\r\nWe had similar problems in the past for instance with Jupyter notebook and the solution was to change the config to save db files to a non NFS mounted volume or to memory. Any similar possibility in spack? Or any other suggestion ?\r\n\r\nMany thanks\r\n\r\nRoberto",
