The build output contains lines like:\r\n```\r\n./boost/python/detail/wrap_python.hpp:50:23: fatal error: pyconfig.h: No such file or directory\r\n # include <pyconfig.h>\r\n                       ^\r\ncompilation terminated.\r\n```\r\nMy `user-config.jam` looks like:\r\n```\r\nusing gcc : : /blues/gpfs/home/software/spack-0.10.0/lib/spack/env/gcc/g++ ;\r\nusing python : 3.6 : /blues/gpfs/home/software/spack-0.10.0/opt/spack/linux-centos6-x86_64/gcc-6.1.0/python-3.6.0-prk6gk3ufbfetjc2bthqokmkjtjnce3j/bin/python : /blues/gpfs/home/software/spack-0.10.0/opt/spack/linux-centos6-x86_64/gcc-6.1.0/python-3.6.0-prk6gk3ufbfetjc2bthqokmkjtjnce3j/include/python3.6m :  ;\r\n```\r\n`/blues/gpfs/home/software/spack-0.10.0/opt/spack/linux-centos6-x86_64/gcc-6.1.0/python-3.6.0-prk6gk3ufbfetjc2bthqokmkjtjnce3j/include/python3.6m` does indeed contain `pyconfig.h`, so I'm surprised by this error message. Anyone ever built Boost with Python 3 before?",
