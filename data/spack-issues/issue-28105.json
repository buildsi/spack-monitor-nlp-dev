    "body": "When `intel-mpi` is called indirectly by e.g. `spack install openfoam` then the resulting spec for the MPI will not contain the sub-string 'libfabric'. Hence, a call to `spec['libfabric']` inside `intel-mpi/package.py` will fail. The workaround I have found is to build a new Spec object around libfabric and use this to determine the libraries in case '+xternal-libfabric' is set.\r\nThe same applies to `intel-oneapi-mpi`.\r\n\r\nThis is an addition to https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/27292\r\n\r\nTaging maintiner @rscohn2. \r\n",
