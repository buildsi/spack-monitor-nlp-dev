    "body": "This PR adds the possibility to test a given package within a docker instance. The artifacts created by different builds (source files and binary caches) are stored in a docker volume, and they may be served on the `host` via `http`. The installation of the spec is done by default with no network access (that should reveal pathological packages, that download stuff at install time).\r\n\r\n#### Example\r\nStarting from this initial status:\r\n```console\r\n$ docker volume list\r\nDRIVER              VOLUME NAME\r\n\r\n$ docker ps -a\r\nCONTAINER ID        IMAGE               COMMAND             CREATED             STATUS              PORTS               NAMES\r\n\r\n$ spack gpg list\r\n/home/mculpo/PycharmProjects/spack/opt/spack/gpg/pubring.gpg\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\r\npub   4096R/A1A440B6 2018-02-08\r\nuid                  Massimiliano Culpo (GPG created for Spack) <massimiliano.culpo@gmail.com>\r\n\r\n$ spack mirror list\r\ndocker    http://0.0.0.0:32679/\r\n```\r\nwe can start to serve the docker volume via `http`:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack docker start mirror\r\n==> Docker mirror started [0.0.0.0:32679]\r\n```\r\nand then try installing specs on docker images:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack docker build zlib\r\n==> Building image for \"centos:7\"\r\n==> Fetching source files\r\n==> Installing specs [--net=none]\r\n==> Creating binary caches\r\n```\r\nIt's possible to set verbosity to see directly what happens within the conatiners:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack -dv docker build --image=ubuntu:16.04 zlib patchelf szip\r\n<lot of output omitted>\r\ngpg: using \"DF0503DE214E4D6D275AD8AEC167A1CBA1A440B6\" as default secret key for signing\r\n==> creating binary cache file for package zlib@1.2.11%gcc@5.4.0+optimize+pic+shared arch=linux-ubuntu16.04-x86_64  \r\n==> creating binary cache file for package libszip@2.1.1%gcc@5.4.0 arch=linux-ubuntu16.04-x86_64  \r\n```\r\nIf you open `0.0.0.0:32679` in your web browser you should be able to see the mirror with sources and binary caches.\r\n\r\n",
