    "body": "Change the default MPI implementation to MPICH. MPICH is reportedly more robust in its defaults, has a battle-proven I/O implementation, is very low in memory leaks and very portable. Leftover from #13216\r\n\r\nThis should just overall reduce the amount of central bug reports we receive from new users, installing default-on MPI software via Spack and not having the experience (yet) to switch default spec concretizations when needed.\r\n\r\ncc @jrood-nrel @ggouaillardet @rblake-llnl @hppritcha ",
