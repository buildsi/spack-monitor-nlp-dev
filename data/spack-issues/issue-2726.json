    "body": "R's configure script has an overly optimistic bit of code to check the zlib version which fails now that the zlib patch version is greater than 9.\r\n\r\nI'm passing a suggested fix to the R folks through friends of mine who are \"connected\".\r\n\r\nI don't think that they can do anything to fix the current version, so I think that we'll need to constrain the current R version to depend_on zlib@1.2.8 (or 9, but we don't have a digest for that and 8's apparently be working fine for everyone...).\r\n\r\nFeedback, before I patch something?",
