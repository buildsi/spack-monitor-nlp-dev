    "body": "Add shared PR mirror to the mirrors spack uses during pipeline generation and rebuild jobs (but only for PR pipelines).  The WIP commit will result in a binary getting built and put in the per-PR mirror, but because I'll remove it from the PR before merging, it should not end up in the shared PR mirror, if PR binary graduation is working properly.",
