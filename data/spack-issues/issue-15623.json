    "body": "## Summary\r\n\r\nThis PR updates and improves the Spack package for [UPC++](https://upcxx.lbl.gov).\r\nI'm an LBL employee and developer on the UPC++ team, as well as the maintainer of this Spack package.\r\n\r\n### Key Improvements:\r\n* Adding new 2020.3.0 release and support for use of develop/master branches\r\n    - Our build infrastructure underwent a major change in this release, switching from a hand-rolled Python2 script to a bash-based autoconf work-alike. \r\n    - The new build system is NOT using autotools (nor does it support some of the more esoteric autoconf options), but the user interface for common builds is similar.\r\n* Add explicit support for an MPI optional dependency\r\n    - New `mpi` variant enables use of the MPI-based spawner (most relevant on loosely coupled clusters), and the (unofficial) mpi-conduit backend\r\n    - This variant is OFF by default, since UPC++ works fine without MPI on many systems, increasing the likelihood first-time Spack users get a working build without needing to correctly setup MPI\r\n* Add support for post-install testing using the test support deployed in the new build infrastructure\r\n* Fix or workaround a few bugs observed during testing \r\n\r\n### Status\r\n\r\nThe new package has been validated with a variety of specs across over seven different systems, including: NERSC cori, ALCF Theta, OLCF Summit, an in-house Linux cluster, and macOS laptops (Mojave and Catalina).  \r\n\r\nThis PR is ready for review.\r\n\r\n",
