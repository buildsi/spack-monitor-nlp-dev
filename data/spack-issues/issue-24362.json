    "body": "Inline codecov annotations make the code hard to read, and they add annotations in files that seemingly have nothing to do with the PR. Sadly, they add a whole lot of noise and not a lot of benefit over looking at the PR on codecov. We should just have people look at the coverage on codecov itself.\r\n\r\nThis PR adds the lines documented [here](https://docs.codecov.com/docs/github-checks#disabling-github-checks-patch-annotations-via-yaml) to `.codecov.yml`.",
