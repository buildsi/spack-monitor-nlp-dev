    "body": "Removed unnecessary code to put values in the cuda_arch flags in\r\nDiHydrogen. These were deprecated when the custom cuda_arch list was\r\nremoved.  Also fixed up the Aluminum dependencies for Hydrogen and\r\nDiHydrogen.  Turns out that Aluminum v0.6.0 didn't have a correct\r\nversion in CMake and thus the interaction with older versions of\r\nHydrogen and DiHydrogen needed to be corrected.",
