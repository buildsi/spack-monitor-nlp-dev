    "body": "Hi:\r\ni'm hoping what i want to achieve with environments is possible, given the way  LMOD works.\r\nOne of the environments I want to do is based on gcc7, \r\nis there a way to have the spack env command switch LMOD's env var of MODULEPATH so that the root of people's module tree changes depending on the environment?\r\n\r\nin essence, i wanted people to see nothing, unless they activated an environment,\r\nand then only 'see' what's in that environment.... or is there some other pattern,\r\npossibly using views, where this is possible?  \r\n\r\nI have some users that want everything, and then some who want a minimalist version,\r\nand then i want to be able to test side by side in the same 'release' versions of packages compiled with different compilers, and have some isolation between the environments, without them having different spack roots. thanks!\r\n",
