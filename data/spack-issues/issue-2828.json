    "body": "I am trying to install our software stack including `Tau` on `MIRA` after few weeks (doing this regularly on other bg-q system without any issue). I can install Tau stand-alone (with the same command) but when I try within Spack I get: \r\n\r\n```\r\ngcc    -O2 -Wl,-rpath,/gpfs/mira-home/kumbhar/spack/opt/spack/bgq-cnk-ppc64/xl-12.1/tau-2.25-4fm5bofq4jr2fnn6tv6hf2ssqqdjxhyq/lib -Wl,-rpath,/gpfs/mira-home/kumbhar/spack/opt/spack/bgq-cnk-ppc64/xl-12.1/tau-2.25-4fm5bofq4jr2fnn6tv6hf2ssqqdjxhyq/lib64 -Wl,-rpath,/bgsys/drivers/ppcfloor/comm/xl/lib -I../include -DTAU_DOT_H_LESS_HEADERS -DTAU_XLC  -w         -c tau_merge.c\r\n\r\nIn file included from tau_merge.c:14:\r\n/usr/include/stdio.h:34:21: error: stddef.h: No such file or directory\r\nIn file included from /usr/include/stdio.h:75,\r\n                 from tau_merge.c:14:\r\n/usr/include/libio.h:53:21: error: stdarg.h: No such file or directory\r\nIn file included from /usr/include/stdio.h:75,\r\n                 from tau_merge.c:14:\r\n```\r\n\r\nabove `gcc` is for `front-end` which is specified in `compilers.yaml` as:\r\n```\r\n- compiler:\r\n    environment: {}\r\n    extra_rpaths: []\r\n    flags: {}\r\n    modules: []\r\n    operating_system: rhel6\r\n    paths:\r\n      cc: /usr/bin/gcc\r\n      cxx: /usr/bin/g++\r\n      f77: /usr/bin/gfortran\r\n      fc: /usr/bin/gfortran\r\n    spec: gcc@4.4.7\r\n```\r\nWondering whats going on (from wrapper?). Any suggestion?",
