    "body": "Spack breaks when installing an environment that contains python + a package that fails to build.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nAssume that you have a package \"somepackage\" that fails to build with spack (in my case this was a one my own python packages that would fail in the setup.py script for some reasons). Do the following to break spack:\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack env create myenv\r\n$ spack env activate myenv\r\n$ spack add python\r\n$ spack add somepackage\r\n$ spack install # this will install everything (including python) up to somepackage, which will fail to install, as expected\r\n```\r\nAfter this series of commands, all spack commands will fail with a RuntimeError from python indicating:\r\n```\r\nRuntimeError: Unable to locate python command in /projects/spack/var/spack/environments/myenv/.spack-env/view/bin\r\n```",
