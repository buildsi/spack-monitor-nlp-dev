    "body": "### Summary\n\nBootstrapping the concretizer currently requires (at least) two parts:\r\n`patchelf` and `clingo`, and these can be installed either with binaries\r\nor source.  But there really is only one knob in `bootstrap.yaml` that\r\ncontrols source or binary.  Technically, it's two variables,\r\n`github-actions` and `spack-install`, but you can't separate patchelf\r\nfrom clingo.\r\n\r\nWhat I'd like is finer grain control for this.  That is, I'd like to\r\nbe able to say install patchelf with sources and clingo with binary.\r\n\r\nFor example, patchelf has no binary, so it has to be source (for now).\r\nClingo is a large build and requires a C++14 compiler (RH 7.x comes\r\nwith gcc/g++ 4.8.5 which only goes to C++11), so I'd prefer a binary\r\ninstall.\r\n\r\nSo, I'd like finer grain control (especially to avoid a long build or\r\none that requires very new versions), but I don't know how this will\r\nevolve if bootstrapping later requires more and more packages.  So,\r\nfeel free to rethink this as things grow.\r\n\r\nThis is not urgent and the current state is not really broken.\r\nBut knobs to turn off a long build are nice.\r\n\r\nping @ala\n\n### Rationale\n\n_No response_\n\n### Description\n\n_No response_\n\n### Additional information\n\n* **Spack:** 0.17.0-413-235edd0\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-broadwell\r\n* **Concretizer:** clingo\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
