    "body": "Added a new base class for the SIP build system. SIP is very similar to QMake in the sense that it contains a `configure.py` script that generates `.pro` files, followed by the usual `qmake`, `make`, `make install`. SIP is also similar to Python's build system in the sense that it is designed to install Python bindings for a C/C++ library like Qt. SIP was originally designed for PyQt and PyKDE but can be used as the build system for any Python/C/C++ project.\r\n\r\n- [x] Added `SIPPackage` base class\r\n- [x] Added `spack create` support\r\n- [x] Added `spack configure` support\r\n- [x] Added `spack build` support\r\n- [x] Added unit tests\r\n- [x] Added documentation\r\n\r\nLet me know if there's anything else I'm forgetting.\r\n\r\nWith this branch, `py-pyqt5` successfully installs and passes the import tests. I was unable to test `py-pyqt4` due to #12139.",
