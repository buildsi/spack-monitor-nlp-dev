    "body": "I was trying to build gcc@4.9.4 on Fedora 28, which has a newer version of glibc than what older versions of gcc support. The patches are already included in the 5/6/7/8/trunk branches but this adds them to the earlier versions (including 4.9). Sadly, we cannot simply download the patches because they include changes to the ChangeLog file.\r\n\r\nI have done a few full builds of gcc@4.9.4 on Fedora 28 (new glibc) and Ubuntu 16.04 (old glibc) and everything seems to work fine.",
