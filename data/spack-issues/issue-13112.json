    "body": "As @healther promised in #9352 here is the current state of our tf-package. \r\n\r\nThis is essentially a cherry-pick onto the current HEAD and we did exactly one test build which is still running right now (@healther will report whether it worked), so use with caution. For example, it explicitly breaks the air-gapped-ability of spack, as bazel insists on downloading its own stuff.\r\n\r\nAll versions I added worked at some point, but I didn't retest them. I hope it is helpful :)\r\n\r\nCloses #9352\r\nCloses #3244\r\nCloses #2043",
