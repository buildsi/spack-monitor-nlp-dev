    "body": "Currently, query arguments in the Spack core are documented on the `Database._query` method, where the functionality is defined.\r\n\r\nFor users of the `spack python` command, this makes the python builtin method `help` less than ideally useful, as `help(spack.store.db.query)` and `help(spack.store.db.query_local)` do not show relevant information.\r\n\r\nThis PR updates the __doc__ attributes for the `Database.query` and `Database.query_local` arguments to mirror everything after the first line of the `Database._query` docstring.",
