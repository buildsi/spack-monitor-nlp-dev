    "body": "This PR allows to break the CUDA compatibility rules. This comes from a problem noticed by @luszczek on Summit (ppc64le architecture) from xSDK tests.\r\n\r\n### Description of the problem\r\nIn `./lib/spack/spack/build_systems/cuda.py`, it is stated that CUDA 9.X can only be used with GCC version < 6. In practice, building with GCC 6 CUDA 9.2 and other 9 versions work properly. This PR gives to the user the freedom to handpick both GCC and CUDA versions, at the risk of using incompatible versions.",
