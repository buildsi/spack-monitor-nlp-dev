    "body": "I would like to see a flag added to `spack fetch` that tells Spack to ignore the downloads cache and any other mirrors.\r\n\r\n### Rationale\r\n\r\nOften when I'm debugging a package that another user is unable to download, I want to see if I can download it myself. Right now, when I run `spack fetch`, it either tells me that the package is already in my downloads cache, or it downloads it from https://spack-llnl-mirror.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com. Because of this, I have no way of testing the `url` or `list_url` of a package.\r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nWe should add a `--no-mirror` flag (or something like that) to `spack fetch`, analogous to the `--no-cache` flag that `spack install` has.",
