    "body": "Fixes #15231 \r\n\r\n>It would be very useful to be able to use definitions as requirements in specs so as to make environments very easy to share and reuse:\r\n\r\n> For example we declare the compiler, core compiler and mpi:\r\n\r\n```\r\n  definitions:\r\n    - mygcc: [ gcc@8.3.0 ]\r\n    - mybasegcc: [ gcc@4.8.5 ]\r\n    - mympi: [ mpich@3.3.2+slurm pmi=pmi2 ]\r\n\r\n  specs:\r\n  - matrix:\r\n    - [$mygcc]\r\n    - [$%mybasegcc]\r\n  \r\n  - matrix:\r\n    - [openblas@0.3.8, $mympi , fftw~mpi]\r\n    - [$%mygcc ]\r\n  - matrix:\r\n    - [openfoam,  fftw]\r\n    - [$^mympi]\r\n    - [$%mygcc]\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis feature only applies to the `^` and `%` sigils, as only compilers and dependencies have an inherent overlap with package names.\r\n\r\n@ilbiondo @alalazo ",
