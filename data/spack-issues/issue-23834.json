    "body": "Improve the way we set the path for the VisIt plugin target directory : we do not assume knowing about the \"platform\" name VisIt uses. This can be useful since xml2cmake may not set the visit.prefix path as expected.\r\nSo now the setting of VISIT_PLUGIN_DIR should be coherent with VisIt, which is a condition for this package to properly extend visit.\r\nAdds the version 3.2.0 of the plugin which works with the latest cgns lib (and with VisIt 3.2.0 at least).\r\n",
