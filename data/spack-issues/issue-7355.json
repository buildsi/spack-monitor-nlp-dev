It can become annoying, everytime you open a new tab or activate a new virtualenv for python.\r\n\r\n#### What I expected\r\n\r\n< 0.2 second of added startup time is reasonable.\r\n\r\n#### What happened instead\r\n\r\n```console\r\n# With the setup-env.sh line\r\n~ \u00bb time zsh -ic \"source ~/.zshrc\"\r\nzsh -ic \"source ~/.zshrc\"  1.70s user 0.46s system 99% cpu 2.159 total\r\n\r\n# Without the setup-env.sh line\r\n~ \u00bb time zsh -ic \"source ~/.zshrc\"\r\nzsh -ic \"source ~/.zshrc\"  0.43s user 0.18s system 99% cpu 0.611 total\r\n```\r\n\r\nSee where the time is spent inside setup-env.sh\r\n```console\r\n# Commenting out the \"build and make available environment-modules\" block \r\n~ \u00bb time zsh -ic \"source ~/.zshrc\"\r\nzsh -ic \"source ~/.zshrc\"  1.31s user 0.40s system 92% cpu 1.850 total\r\n\r\n# Commenting out the \"Set up modules and dotkit search paths in the user environment\" block\r\n~ \u00bb time zsh -ic \"source ~/.zshrc\"\r\nzsh -ic \"source ~/.zshrc\"  0.50s user 0.31s system 100% cpu 0.797 total\r\n```\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n 1.
