    "body": "fixes #26598\r\n\r\nThe ASP-based solver maximizes the number of values in multi-valued variants (if other higher order constraints are met), to avoid cases where only a subset of the values that have been specified on the command line or imposed by another constraint are selected.\r\n\r\nHere we swap the priority of this optimization target with the selection of the default providers, to avoid unexpected results like the one in #26598",
