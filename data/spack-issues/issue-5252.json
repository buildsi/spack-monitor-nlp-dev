    "body": "I've received bug reports that not all CMake packages make use of the implicit variables (CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, etc) for their generated makefiles. \r\n\r\nI've reverted the default flag handler for cmake packages in response, and updated the documentation.\r\n\r\nIf someone has a better idea for how to propagate compiler flags through CMake in a programmatic way that exposes those flags to the build system, let me know and let's build another PR for that.",
