    "body": "This PR does a sweep of CRAN R packages in Spack, and does the following:\r\n\r\n- add new versions of packages if available\r\n- make sure the `cran` attribute is set\r\n- add new packages as required\r\n\r\nDue to adding the `cran` attribute, almost all R CRAN packages had\r\nchanges. Since almost all packages were being touched, I also tried to\r\nstandardize the formatting of the packages.\r\n\r\n- make sure there is a short and long description\r\n- have dependencies specified in the same order as in the DESCRIPTION\r\n  file\r\n- place `when` directives at the end\r\n\r\nHaving consistency makes it easier to process these in bulk. The process\r\nis script driven but requires interaction. I am hopeful that the\r\nconsistent formatting will allow for further automation.\r\n\r\nAll of the packages in this PR were built with gcc-10.3.0 prior to\r\nsubmitting the PR.",
