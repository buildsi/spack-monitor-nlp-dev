    "body": "When using the `spack compiler add` command for the Intel compiler there is a mismatch between the package version and the compiler entry. For example, the package version is 19.0.3 but the compiler entry has a spec value of 19.0.3.199. This causes issues with the lmod module layout as well as other breakage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack versions -s intel\r\n==> Safe versions (already checksummed):\r\n  19.0.3  18.0.4  18.0.1  17.0.6  17.0.3  17.0.0  16.0.2\r\n  19.0.1  18.0.3  18.0.0  17.0.5  17.0.2  16.0.4  15.0.6\r\n  19.0.0  18.0.2  17.0.7  17.0.4  17.0.1  16.0.3  15.0.1\r\n$ spack install intel@19.0.3\r\n$ module load intel/19.0.3\r\n$ spack compiler add --scope=site\r\n==> Added 1 new compiler to /opt/packages/gpjohnsn/opt/ssoft/spack/etc/spack/compilers.yaml\r\n    intel@19.0.3.199\r\n==> Compilers are defined in the following files:\r\n    /opt/packages/gpjohnsn/opt/ssoft/spack/etc/spack/compilers.yaml\r\n...\r\n```\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\nlinux-centos7-x86_64\r\n",
