    "body": "See #27369 for motivation.  This forces python to use the ncursesw include files and library to build the curses packages.  This is to ensure that (1) it uses a consistent, matching set of headers and libraries and (2) it uses specifically wide ncurses, as the curses python module does not behave well with non-wide.  Otherwise, python's `setup.py` by default uses whichever curses library comes first in the `ldd` linkage of readline, and explicitly adds `/usr/include/ncursesw` to the include path if it finds ncursesw.",
