    "body": "During the `autoreconf` phase, we need to explicitly pass a list of directories in which to look for m4 headers. Previously, we only checked for `pkgconfig`, but there are many other packages that provide m4 headers. For example, among the software I currently have installed, I see the following packages with m4 headers:\r\n\r\n* automake\r\n* cmake\r\n* freetype\r\n* gettext\r\n* libgpg-error\r\n* libksba\r\n* libassuan\r\n* curl\r\n* libgcrypt\r\n* libtool\r\n* npth\r\n* autoconf-archive\r\n\r\nFor a concrete example, while working on #15783, autoreconf failed unless autoconf-archive was added. I've also had problems with gettext being missing in the past.",
