    "body": "+ Added versions 7.3.0 and 7.4.0.\r\n+ Change several variants to be default TRUE since most consumers need these variants enabled (eospac, lapack, parmetis, superlu-dist). Change variant name for `+superlu_dist` to use hyphen instead of underscore.  This makes the variant name consistent with the spackage name for `superlu-dist`.\r\n+ Clean up `depends_on` instructions and avoid specifying `type` when possible.\r\n+ Provide patch files that are necessary for some machines (mostly Cray machines).",
