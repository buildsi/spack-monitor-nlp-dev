    "body": "I would like to contribute a new package for SPACK called NTPoly.\r\n\r\nNTPoly is a massively parallel library for computing the functions of sparse, hermitian matrices based on polynomial expansions. For sufficiently sparse matrices, most of the matrix functions in NTPoly can be computed in linear time.\r\n\r\nI would like to thank the SPACK developers for giving a tutorial a few weeks ago at RIKEN, and I hope that this PR lines up with what they taught us!",
