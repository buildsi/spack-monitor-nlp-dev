    "body": "Recent versions of magics allow grib support to be provided by either eccodes or grib-api. Some applications may require one or the other, so we provide an eccodes variant of magics. This is more flexible than hard-coding a choice based on the magics version number.\r\n\r\nWe also ensure that recent versions of magics can be patched to avoid an in-built dependency on the system python.",
