    "body": "Loading an environment/module breaks the `man` command. `MANPATH` is used to give a list of directories to search for man pages. The default (no path) searches typical system locations. As soon as you populate `MANPATH` (e.g. `/home/adam/foo/.spack-env/view/share/man:/home/adam/foo/.spack-env/view/man`), it no longer searches system locations. You need to add a trailing colon to `MANPATH` to get it to search system locations.\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\nThe issue affects environments:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack env activate foo\r\n$ man bash\r\nNo manual entry for bash\r\n```\r\nIt also affects modules and the load command:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack load zlib\r\n$ man bash\r\nNo manual entry for bash\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.2-1395-4c976dfe6\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.7\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu20.04-skylake (via WSL)\r\n\r\n### Known Workarounds\r\n\r\nFor now, I can do this to solve the issue:\r\n```console\r\n$ export MANPATH+=:\r\n```\r\nIn the long run, Spack should be smart enough to always add a trailing colon to `MANPATH`, even if we have to make a special case for it.\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n- [x] I have run the failing commands in debug mode and reported the output\r\n\r\nThis is the best summary of the problem I've found so far: https://github.com/fish-shell/fish-shell/issues/2090\r\n\r\n@alalazo ",
