    "body": "Add binary package for hpcviewer and hpctraceviewer for the Rice\r\nhpctoolkit on Linux x86_64, ppc64 and ppc64le.\r\n\r\n----------\r\n\r\nI may be pushing the boundaries of flake with the long sha256 strings.\r\nBut folding them to the next line is ugly.  So, we'll see how the\r\njudge rules.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlso, hpcviewer depends on java, but the tcl module that spack\r\ncreated for hpcviewer doesn't depend on java.  I was expecting that\r\n`module load hpcviewer` would also load jdk as a dependency, but it\r\ndidn't.\r\n\r\nThe module file sets `PATH` and `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH` and prints a help\r\nstring.  Nothing else, no mention of java.\r\n\r\nDid I miss something, or do tcl modules just not support dependencies?\r\n",
