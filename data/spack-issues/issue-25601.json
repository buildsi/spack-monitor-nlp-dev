    "body": "We can see what is in the bootstrap store with `spack find -b`, and you can clean it with `spack clean -b`, but we can't do much else with it, and if there are bootstrap issues they can be hard to debug.\r\n\r\nWe already have `spack --mock`, which allows you to swap in the mock packages from the command line. This PR introduces `spack -b` / `spack --bootstrap`, which runs all of spack with `ensure_bootstrap_configuration()` set. This means that you can run `spack -b find`, `spack -b install`, `spack -b spec`, etc. to see what *would* happen with bootstrap configuration, to remove specific bootstrap packages, etc. This will hopefully make developers' lives easier as they deal with bootstrap packages.\r\n\r\nThis PR also uses a `nullcontext` context manager. `nullcontext` has been implemented in several other places in Spack, and this PR consolidates them to `llnl.util.lang`, with a note that we can delete the function if we ever reqyire a new enough Python.\r\n\r\n- [x] introduce `spack --bootstrap` option\r\n- [x] consolidated all `nullcontext` usages to `llnl.util.lang`",
