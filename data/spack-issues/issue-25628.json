    "body": "fixes #21215 \r\n\r\nThis PR makes two unit tests that were failing on macOS, with Python 3.8 and `clingo` PASS. The fix for that was adding an explicit `__reduce__` method to the `SpecBuildInterface`, which is an object wrapper around a spec. Without it `pickle` _sometimes_ would try to search for the wrapped class in the module containing the base class of `SpecBuildInterface`. \r\n\r\nModifications:\r\n\r\n- [x] Add a `__reduce__` method to `SpecBuildInterface`\r\n- [x] Switch the macOS unit tests to `clingo` to check that #21215 is effectively solved\r\n\r\nThere are still questions I don't know how to answer:\r\n- Why only those two tests were failing, given the abundance of use of the subscript notation with specs?\r\n- Are there other classes that may need to be serialized explicitly?",
