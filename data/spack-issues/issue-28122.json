    "body": "The following part was modified through the change log of version 3.4\r\n\r\n> The Class F problem has been added to seven of the benchmarks (BT, SP, LU, CG, MG, FT, and EP).\r\n> The Class E problem has been added to the IS benchmark.\r\n\r\n-> Refer to above,  Classes C, D, E  and F are not available for DT.\r\n And  Class E, F is not available for IS at @3.3.1, Class F is not available for IS at @3.4.1.\r\n\r\n> Because of dynamic memory allocation, compilations for different process counts are no longer necessary. The number of processes is solely determined and checked at runtime.\r\n\r\n-> In version 3.4.1, 'the number of processes'  option does not apply.\r\n\r\n> The MPIF77 or F77 flag in make.def is renamed to MPIFC or FC to reflect the fact that a Fortran 90 or newer compiler is required.\r\n\r\n->MPIFC and FC flags were added.",
