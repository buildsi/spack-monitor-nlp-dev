    "body": "`spack configure` and `spack build` are designed stop at a certain phase of the package installation process for debugging purposes. However, this only works for `CMakePackage`, `AutotoolsPackage`, and `PythonPackage`. These 3 build systems contain separate build and install phases.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't work for `MakefilePackage` even though it has a build phase:\r\n```\r\n$ spack build lammps\r\n==> Error: Package lammps has no build phase, or its build phase is not separated from install\r\n```\r\nIt also doesn't work for a `Package` class with manually added build phases:\r\n```\r\n$ spack build qbank\r\n==> Error: Package qbank has no build phase, or its build phase is not separated from install\r\n```\r\nSee #3641 for this qbank package.\r\n\r\nBased on the commands, it looks like we are looking for the package base class in `build_systems_to_phase`, a dictionary that converts the phase to the name of the function. If the base class isn't in this dictionary, it crashes, even if the package has a build phase defined.\r\n\r\n@alalazo ",
