    "body": "In older versions of Cython, the `cython` executable contains:\r\n```python\r\nfrom pkg_resources import load_entry_point\r\n```\r\nIn newer versions of Cython, it contains:\r\n```python\r\ntry:\r\n    from importlib.metadata import distribution\r\nexcept ImportError:\r\n    try:\r\n        from importlib_metadata import distribution\r\n    except ImportError:\r\n        from pkg_resources import load_entry_point\r\n```\r\n`importlib.metadata` was added in Python 3.8. `importlib_metadata` is the same library backported to older versions of Python. Instead of adding a new dependency, I figured it would be easier to fall back on `setuptools`, which provides `pkg_resources`.\r\n\r\nThanks to @ikitayama for reporting this bug over Slack.",
