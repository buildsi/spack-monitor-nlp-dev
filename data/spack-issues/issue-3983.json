    "body": "I'm now on an Ubuntu machine working with Clang. After implementing the compiler wrapper fix proposed in #3903, Ipopt still did not compile but showed the error \r\n`\"don't have function for random number generator\"`. \r\n\r\nA search revealed that this error comes from the Linux version of Clang (see [here](https://github.com/JuliaOpt/Ipopt.jl/issues/13) and scroll to the end). The suggestion there is to add `coin_skip_warn_cxxflags=yes` to the configure call.\r\n\r\n In file\r\nhttps://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/ipopt/package.py\r\nyou see the following section:\r\n```\r\nconfigure_args = [\r\n  \"--prefix=%s\" % prefix,\r\n  \"--with-mumps-incdir=%s\" % mumps_dir.include,\r\n  \"--with-mumps-lib=%s\" % mumps_libcmd,\r\n  \"--enable-shared\",\r\n  \"--with-blas-incdir=%s\" % blas_dir.include,\r\n  \"--with-blas-lib=%s\" % blas_lib,\r\n  \"--with-lapack-incdir=%s\" % lapack_dir.include,\r\n  \"--with-lapack-lib=%s\" % lapack_lib\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\n\r\nIf this section is extended to account for the additional flag as\r\n```\r\nconfigure_args = [\r\n  \"--prefix=%s\" % prefix,\r\n  \"--with-mumps-incdir=%s\" % mumps_dir.include,\r\n  \"--with-mumps-lib=%s\" % mumps_libcmd,\r\n  \"--enable-shared\",\r\n  \"coin_skip_warn_cxxflags=yes\",\r\n  \"--with-blas-incdir=%s\" % blas_dir.include,\r\n  \"--with-blas-lib=%s\" % blas_lib,\r\n  \"--with-lapack-incdir=%s\" % lapack_dir.include,\r\n  \"--with-lapack-lib=%s\" % lapack_lib\r\n  ]\r\n```\r\nthen the build works fine for me. Note that this additional flag does not have the preceding '--'.",
