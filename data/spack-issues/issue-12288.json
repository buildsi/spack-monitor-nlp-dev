    "body": "If GCC or Clang is used to compile musl, a wrapper script is installed into `prefix.bin` however the result is unusable since the build environment picks up the spack compile wrapper path as the default.  This PR fixes the problem by influencing the configure script _a priori_ (and explicitly calls for no wrapper script to be installed should alternate compilers be used to build this package).",
