    "body": "This commit makes two fundamental corrections to affected tests:\r\n1) Changes `matches` to the correct `match` argument for `pytest.raises` (except tests checking for `SystemExit`);\r\n2) Replaces the `match` argument for tests expecting `SystemExit` (since the exit code is retained instead) with `capsys` error message capture.\r\n\r\nBoth changes are needed to ensure the associated exception message is actually checked.",
