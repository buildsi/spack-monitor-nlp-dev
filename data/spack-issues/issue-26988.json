    "body": "This refactors the cmake argument construction in the LLVM package to use CMake package helper functions (`define`, `define_from_variant`).\r\n\r\nThere are two changes from the current version as seen from diffing the cmake command line arguments:\r\n- CMake type annotations (which are purely superficial) are normalized e.g. from Bool/PATH to STRING\r\n- Variant-based flags are explicitly defined as 'off' when the variant is inactive, as opposed to relying on LLVM's default cmake logic to turn them off. (For example, `-DLLVM_USE_SPLIT_DWARF:BOOL=OFF` is set when `~split_dwarf`.)",
