    "body": "An update for HDF5:\r\n- some refactoring;\r\n- allows for thread safety and high-level interface at the same time ('hl' becomes a variant);\r\n- returns 'unsupported' variant (see #520) to allow unsupported combinations only when it's specified explicitly;\r\n- additional conflict statement for mpi and cxx.\r\n\r\nI would also make \\~mpi by default because every time we want to install something that needs just NetCDF we have to write: install A+netcdf ^netcdf\\~mpi ^hdf5\\~mpi to avoid compilation of MPI library. But I don't know which case is more often.\r\n\r\nThere will be a discussion probably.\r\n",
