    "body": "### Rationale\r\n\r\nWith over 5k packages navigating the builtin repo is quite cumbersome, specifically through the GitHub UI:\r\n\r\n>  Sorry, we had to truncate this directory to 1,000 files. 4,582 entries were omitted from the list. \r\n\r\n### Description\r\n\r\nSome package managers choose to create subdirs for the first letter:\r\n\r\n``a/ b/ c/ ... z/``\r\n\r\nOr even\r\n\r\n```aa/ ab/ ac/ ... ba/ bb/ ... zz/```\r\n\r\nOr\r\n\r\n```a/a/ a/b/ ... z/z/```\r\n\r\nThat would make browsing through github a bit easier.",
