    "body": "I'm getting unusual rebuilding... some packages seem to want to install a new version every time I do a `spack install`, for no apparent reason.\r\n\r\nIn order to debug this, I would like a command flag on `spack spec` that display the hash code of each node in the DAG.  Then I can (for example) do a bunch of `spack spec` calls and see if/when the hashcode changes for certain dependencies.\r\n",
