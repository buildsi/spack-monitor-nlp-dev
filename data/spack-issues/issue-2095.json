    "body": "In general... Spack packages should not build documentation unless asked to do so (eg. with a `+docs` variant).  Reasons:\n1. Building docs can involve large/annoying dependencies (`doxygen`, `latex`, etc.)\n2. Users don't usually want docs except for packages near the top of the DAG for a particular user's needs.  CGAL might be a great and clever system; but people installing stuff five levels up just don't care.\n3. Even if a packages is close to the top, users often just rely on on-line docs anyway.\n\nI'm guilty of not following this advice (need to fix for `glint2` and `icebin` packages).\n",
