    "body": "I want to start a more general discussion to drive a refactoring based on #3915, #3965, #3967 and related PRs. Basically, I think that all the `do_*` methods that are now in `PackageBase` are logically tied to specs rather than packages. To be more precise they are tied to **concrete specs**. If people agree with this I'll start moving them from `PackageBase` to `Spec`, taking care of checking that the prerequisite on being concrete is respected.\r\n\r\nWaiting for feedback before proceeding.\r\n\r\n",
