This can lead to reference errors for example given:\r\n\r\n```\r\nX-[L]->Y\r\nX-[B]->Z1\r\nY-[B]->Z2\r\n```\r\n\r\nThis PR\r\n\r\n* Updates specs to track dag hashes both with and without build dependencies\r\n* Updates the lockfile format to index based on the full dag hash (including build deps)\r\n* Automatically updates older lockfiles to newer ones (where the indices are hashes based on the full dag)",
