    "body": "gromacs package resolves cmake as `3.9.6`. Trying it with `3.12.2` works. Seems like the reason is \r\n\r\n```\r\n     depends_on('cmake@2.8.8:3.9.99', type='build')\r\n     depends_on('cmake@3.4.3:3.9.99', type='build', when='@2018:')\r\n```\r\n\r\nthat the definition only reaches `3.9.99`, should be extended to `3.19.99` to reach `3.12.2`. \r\n\r\nTwo things to note here:\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Undefined end does not go beyond >= 10 in the minor version, e.g. `3.10.0`\r\n```\r\n     depends_on('cmake@3.4.3:', type='build', when='@2018:')\r\n```\r\n\r\ndid not work as well. It only reached `3.9.99`.\r\n\r\n2. Somehow it the `when` statement was ignored. Not sure why",
