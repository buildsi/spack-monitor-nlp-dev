    "body": "I noticed a lot of packages will have something like this:\r\n```python\r\nif '+mpi' in spec:\r\n    config_args.append('CC={0}'.format(spec['mpi'].mpicc))\r\n```\r\nMy question is, if we change `CC` to be something other than Spack's compiler wrapper, does the compiler wrapper still get called? If not, how are things like `-L/path/to/dep`, `-I/path/to/dep`, and RPATH logic for every dependency included in the build?",
