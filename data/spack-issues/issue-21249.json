    "body": "### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\npicard doesn't automagically allow you to use newer versions than coded in `package.py` because of the need to use `version(..., expand=False)`.  Therefore a manual version bump is needed for the latest version.\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install picard@2.24.0\r\n...\r\n==> Error: Unable to parse extension from https://github.com/broadinstitute/picard/releases/download/2.24.0/picard.jar.\r\n\r\nIf this URL is for a tarball but does not include the file extension\r\nin the name, you can explicitly declare it with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n    version('1.2.3', 'hash', extension='tar.gz')\r\n\r\nIf this URL is for a download like a .jar or .whl that does not need\r\nto be expanded, or an uncompressed installation script, you can tell\r\nSpack not to expand it with the following syntax:\r\n\r\n    version('1.2.3', 'hash', expand=False)\r\n```\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack debug report\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.0-940-88cafacd09\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.3\r\n* **Platform:** linux-pureos9-skylake\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n```\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n\r\n```console\r\n$ spack maintainers picard\r\n(no output) \r\n```\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [ ] (can't build, so build log doesn't apply) I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
