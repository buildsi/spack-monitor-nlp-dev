    "body": "with out the /opt/rocm installtion we are currently seeing  warning WARNING \"Profiling API header not found. Disabling roctracer integration. Use -DPROF_API_HEADER_PATH=<path to prof_protocol.h header>\" while building  hip.\r\nAlso , when the rocm rpm's are installed in the /opt/rocm path it is picking up the header files from /opt/rocm path which i think is not correct ( -I/opt/rocm/roctracer/include/ext is included )   while compiling the hip files eg hip_context.cpp  \r\n\r\nthe change inside the hip recipe is meant to fix this issue . After the changes i do not see the warning and also header file is properly picked.\r\nexample o/p from the terminal - Profiling API: /tmp/root/spack-stage/spack-stage-hip-4.1.0-csml555jn4u7qbl3mgplbxrjvw36gvlp/spack-src/roctracer/inc/ext \r\n\r\nthe changes to the rocprofiler-dev is cleanup code. basically replaces with smaller lines of code.\r\n\r\ntesting - i have built hip for rocm-4.2.0 ,rocm-4.1.0 and rocfft recipe for rocm-4.2.0 and rocm-4.1.0 \r\nfor rocprofiler-dev i have built and installed for rocm-4.2.0 and rocm-4.1.0 releases.\r\n",
