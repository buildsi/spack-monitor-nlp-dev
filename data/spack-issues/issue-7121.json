    "body": "Spack currently has support for binary packaging, but we don't have a public mirror for source or binaries.  Implement a public mirror and keep it current with sources (binaries are handled in #7116).\r\n\r\n- [x] stand up an S3 instance that Spack can use to house sources and binaries for builds\r\n- [ ] In Spack's default settings (`etc/spack/defaults`), set this S3 instance as a fallback if package sites go down \r\n- [ ] New source tarballs to Spack's mirror *after* they are merged to `develop`\r\n    * require merge before add so that not just any PR adds to the mirror",
