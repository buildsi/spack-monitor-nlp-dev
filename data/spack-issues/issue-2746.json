    "body": "The repository used by the texlive installer defaults to a redirector that sends one off to various URLs depending on <fill in the blank>.\r\n\r\nThis is problematic because all of the mirrors do not update in synchrony and bad tarballs often hang around for a while.\r\n\r\nThis leads to problems that are particularly hard to diagnose because you're likely to end up using a different repo the next time around.\r\n\r\nThis commit constraints the package to a particular, mainstream, repository.  It's not fast, but it's consistent and usually correct.\r\n\r\nIt also updates the installer digest, because no day is complete without updating it at least (sigh) once.\r\n\r\n[what @tgamblin wants, @tgamblin gets... :smile:]",
