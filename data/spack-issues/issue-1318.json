    "body": "While working on #1156, I noticed the following behavior. I have a new package, py-meep, that depends on numpy, scipy, and matplotlib. When I ran `spack activate py-meep`, it activated py-meep and py-numpy, but nothing else. It didn't give me an error message saying that py-scipy and py-matplotlib weren't activated.\n",
