If one wants to filter by arch we could have something like `spack test list --arch=$(spack arch)` as an option to view by current arch and one can specify any other arch they have in mind.\r\n\r\nRight now we see specs list for different arch in output of `spack test list` what'd i'd like to see is only for current architecture\r\n\r\n```\r\nshahzebsiddiqui@iris19:~> spack test list | head -n 8\r\n-- linux-opensuse_leap15-cascadelake / clang@11.0.0 -------------\r\ngahbtdd libxml2@2.9.10\r\ncqhyezh libxml2@2.9.10\r\nyzxu6en m4@1.4.18\r\n\r\n-- linux-opensuse_leap15-cascadelake / clang@2020.7.0.0730 ------\r\ncjr6plk cmake@3.17.3\r\nh6a57qh cmake@3.18.1\r\n```\r\n\r\nCurrent arch: \r\n```\r\nshahzebsiddiqui@iris19:~> spack arch\r\nlinux-opensuse_leap15-skylake\r\n```",
