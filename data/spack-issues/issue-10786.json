    "body": "NetCDF-4.6.3 has been released and follows the naming scheme introduced in NetCDF-4.6.2 which is the addition of \"-c\" prior to the version number.  Added a `url_for_version()` function to compose this URL.  Also updated the `url` to point to a version using the new naming convention so future versions will be discoverable using `spack checksum netcdf`.  Removed explicit url from the 4.6.2 version statement and added version statement for 4.6.3 with checksum.",
