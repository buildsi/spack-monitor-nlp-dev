The gold linker does not exist on Darwin, and binutils on Darwin provides an assembler that doesn't work for Boost.\n- Introduce a variant that specifies whether to build with binutils, defaulting to true for backward compatibility\n- Auto-detect whether we build on Darwin; in this case, set the gold and binutils variant defaults to false\n- Clean up configure flags for as and ld\n",
