    "body": "It is too simplistic to assume the path to a dependency's include directory as being `prefix.include`.  For example, this path doesn't even exist for `intel-mkl` (unfortunately).  The end result is that Trilinos will build but a bogus path will be injected into its installed CMake files so that future packages which use its artifacts die a horrible death.  This PR fixes the `*_INCLUDE_DIRS` definition to point to where each dependency has advertised its headers to reside.",
