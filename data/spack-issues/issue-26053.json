    "body": "Hey there!\n\nI'd like to report a security issue but cannot find contact instructions on your repository.\n\nIf not a hassle, might you kindly add a `SECURITY.md` file with an email, or another contact method? GitHub [recommends](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/getting-started/adding-a-security-policy-to-your-repository) this best practice to ensure security issues are responsibly disclosed, and it would serve as a simple instruction for security researchers in the future.\n\nThank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you!\n\n(cc @huntr-helper)",
