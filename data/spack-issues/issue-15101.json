    "body": "Fixes https://github.com/spack/spack/issues/11698\r\n\r\nThe Spack `stat` package installs a python script in its `bin/` directory that is used at run time. This script references the Spack-installed instance of Python. When `stat` is relocated to a view, this script needs to be updated to use the Python which was relocated to the view.\r\n\r\nTODOs\r\n\r\n- [ ] refactor this logic into a module that other packages can use if they happen to create python scripts",
