    "body": "@tgamblin @alalazo \n\nThe `ibmisc` package depends on `py-cython`: https://github.com/LLNL/spack/blob/develop/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/ibmisc/package.py\n\nWhen I run `spack setup` from a \"clean\" environment, `spec['py-cython'].prefix.bin` is not ending up in the `$PATH`.  But if I `spack load py-cython` before running `spack setup`, it DOES work out OK (hence why I didn't catch this problem earlier).  I'm 90% confident that the same behavior would be observed running `spack install` as with `spack setup`.\n\nLooking at the generated module file for `py-cython`, I see that it adds to `$PATH` correctly.\n\nDoes anyone know why this is happening?\n\n(Remember that the `$PATH` from `spconfig.py` is taken directly from the environment that Spack WOULD HAVE used in a regular `spack install`; see `install_setup()` in `lib/spack/spack/package.py`.)\n",
