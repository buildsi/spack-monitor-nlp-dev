    "body": "Consider the text for inclusion:\n\nNo.  All the specs that exist at package build time are present on the package -- that's a prerequisite for concreteness.  This is intentional so that we can match variants properly -- concretization needs to know whether an install either a) had a variant enabled, b) had it disabled, or c) did not _know_ about that variant at build time.  Case (c) is important because if some _future_ build asks for +ucs4 or -ucs4, we know we have to rebuild.\n\nThere should be no issue with the matching here.  The spec 'python' will match either of these.  If you do this:\n\ndepends_on('python')\n\nThat means your package would be happy with any python build.  If you say this:\n\ndepends_on('python~ucs4')\nor\ndepends_on('python+ucs4')\n\nYou're asking for one where ucs4 is guaranteed to be disabled/enabled.\n",
