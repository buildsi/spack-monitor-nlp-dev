    "body": "Currently we have a package (dd4hep) that `depends_on('assimp@5.0.2:')`, but the most recent version other than master is 5.0.1. This adds a way to satisfy the dd4hep dependency without having to install a moving target like master.\r\n\r\nThe changelog for the 5.1 series is pretty long, but a search for build system changes didn't indicate anything that requires changes to the package.py.\r\n\r\nTested this build on `arch=linux-ubuntu21.10-skylake %gcc-11.2.0`.\r\n\r\nNo maintainer (no, thanks, spackbot). Some maintainers of direct dependents who might be interested: @drbenmorgan @vvolkl (dd4hep), @jppelteret  @luca-heltai (dealii), @RemiLacroix-IDRIS (vapor)",
