    "body": "Hello,\r\nIs there a way to distribute pre-built binaries via SPACK? \r\nI realize that building from sources is the main workflow for spack packages, but there are several places in documentation mentioning binary packages, binary caches and binary mirrors, so I guess it possible. However, I cannot find more information on that. 'spack create' help has no options regarding composing package from just binaries without using source code. \r\nCould you give me a hint where to find some information/instructions if it is possible in general.\r\nThanks.
