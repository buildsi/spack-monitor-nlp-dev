    "body": "If one runs `spack install cmake` inside ctest, then cmake sometimes fails to install properly.\r\n\r\nFixes:\r\n\r\n1. Improve environment cleaning: Remove `$DASHBOARD_TEST_FROM_CTEST`\r\n\r\n2. Add `-DCMake_TEST_INSTALL=OFF` to `bootstrap_args()`\r\n\r\nBoth alone would fix the issue, but it seems more sensible to apply them together: Cleaning the environment is anyway a good idea and passing explicit options seems good too.",
