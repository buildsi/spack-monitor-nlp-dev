    "body": "I've shamelessly stolen some code from `setup-env.sh` to get `setup-env.csh` working a bit better. It's not perfect and as exciting as `setup-env.sh` but it's a good first step.\r\n\r\nNow one doesn't need to set `$SYS_TYPE` but will use spack python to retrieve it.\r\n\r\nNOTE: I'm using lmod on my laptop, so I might be trying to use that _sp_lmod_root at some point, but for now I'm just doing:\r\n```\r\n  module use -a $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/lmod/darwin-elcapitan-x86_64\r\n  module unuse $SPACK_ROOT/share/spack/modules/darwin-elcapitan-x86_64\r\n```\r\nin my `.tcshrc` until I learn Spack a bit better. (Would I do:\r\n```\r\nmodules:\r\n   enable::\r\n      - lmod\r\n```\r\nif I only want lua modules?)\r\n\r\nFixes #3924. The script now prints an error message if `SPACK_ROOT` is not set.",
