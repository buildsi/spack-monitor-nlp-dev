    "body": "If A depends on B and C, and B depends on a virtual package while C depends on a specific implementation of that package, Spack will fail during concretization. This example was discovered with `py-yt`. `py-yt` depends on `py-matplotlib` which depends on `py-pillow`. `py-yt` also depends on `py-scikit-image`, which depends on `pil`. Even though `py-pillow` is the default implementation of `pil`, Spack crashes with the following message:\r\n```\r\n==> Error: Cannot depend on 'py-pillow^binutils@2.26:^bison^bzip2@1.0.6%gcc@6.1.0 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64^flex^gettext@0.19:^help2man^m4^ncurses@6.0%gcc@6.1.0 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64^openssl@1.0.2j%gcc@6.1.0 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64^py-setuptools@25.2.0%gcc@6.1.0 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64^python@2.7.13%gcc@6.1.0+tk~ucs4 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64^readline@6.3%gcc@6.1.0 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64^sqlite@3.8.5%gcc@6.1.0 arch=linux-centos6-x86_64^tcl^tk@8.3:^zlib@1.2.10%gcc@6.1.0+pic arch=linux-centos6-x86_64' twice\r\n```",
