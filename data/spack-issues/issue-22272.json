    "body": "Currently, regardless of a spec being concrete or not, we validate its variants in `spec_clauses` (part of `SpackSolverSetup`).  \r\n\r\nThis PR skips the check if the spec is concrete.\r\n\r\nThe reason we want to do this is so that the solver setup class (really, `spec_clauses`) can be used for cases when we just want the logic statements / facts (is that what they are called?) and we don't need to re-validate an already concrete spec.  We can't change existing concrete specs, and we have to be able to handle them *even if they violate constraints in the current spack*.  This happens in practice if we are doing the validation for a spec produced by a different spack install.\r\n\r\nSigned-off-by: vsoch <vsoch@users.noreply.github.com>",
