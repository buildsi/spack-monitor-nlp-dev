Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install blaze\r\n```\r\nThe error seems to be from not being able to find BLAS. Although blas doesn't seem to be a dependency of blaze, I did install openblas via spack and tried a clean install and it failed in the same way. \r\n\r\nI've tried to reproduce this issue on a different architecture: \r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.1-633-f917f71\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-centos7-haswell\r\n\r\nand the installation succeeded, so this might be an Ubuntu issue. \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n\r\n* **Spack:** 0.14.1-628-f39335578\r\n* **Python:** 3.7.1\r\n* **Platform:** linux-ubuntu18.04-skylake\r\n\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n\r\n<!-- Please upload the following files. They should be present in the stage directory of the failing build. Also upload any config.log or similar file if one exists. -->\r\n\r\n* [spack-build-out.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/4489251/spack-build-out.txt)\r\n\r\n* [spack-build-env.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/4489254/spack-build-env.txt)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
