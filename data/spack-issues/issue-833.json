    "body": "The changes in this pull request make the following changes to the Zoltan package:\n- Implement the standard `+shared` and `+debug` variants.\n- Add support for two more Zoltan versions: v3.6 and v3.8.\n\nI've verified that the new `+shared` variant works both with and without the `+mpi` variant and that these combinations compile and can be linked with external code for versions v3.3 and v3.83 on CHAOS when compiling with gcc@4.7.2.  I've also verified that the new versions (i.e. v3.6 and v3.8) compile with the standard package variants in the same architecture/compiler environment.\n",
