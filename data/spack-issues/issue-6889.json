    "body": "This replaces ad-hoc changes to `v0.11.0` in the tutorial with a cherry-picked commit from the development branch which was later added to resolve the issue. The commit includes the following changes:\r\n\r\n* Updated function which checks if a binary file needs relocation. Previously this was incorrectly identifying ELF binaries as symbolic links (so they were being excluded from relocation). Added test to check that ELF binaries are not considered symlinks.\r\n* relocate_text was not replacing paths in text files. Added test to check that text files are relocated properly (i.e. paths in the file are converted to the new prefix).\r\n* Exclude backup files created by filter_file when installing from binary cache.\r\n* Update write_buildinfo_file method signature to distinguish between the spec prefix and the working directory for the binary cache package.",
