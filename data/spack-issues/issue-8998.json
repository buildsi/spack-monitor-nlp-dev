    "body": "Cube 4.4 has been split up into three packages (cubelib, cubew, and cube-gui). We should make separate spack packages for these as well to manage dependencies explicitly. \r\n\r\nA specific issue is that the current cube spack package uses the \"bundled\" cube tarball for 4.4, which always builds the GUI even though that is unnecessary for dependents such as Score-P.
