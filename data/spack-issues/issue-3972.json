    "body": "This PR does the following:\r\n- Adds default module names to compilers so that spack may recognize them when they are available on a system.\r\n- Checks if modulecmd is in the current PATH. If it is, it searches the list of available modules for those matching default module names that spack knows about. These are then used to create compilers.\r\n\r\nThis greatly eases pain for people deploying spack on a new system which uses modules and may have many compiler versions available.",
