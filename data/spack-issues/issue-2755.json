Package zlib requires version :1.2.8, but spec asked for 1.2.10\r\n```\r\nR uses the following dependencies:\r\n```python\r\ndepends_on('zlib')\r\ndepends_on('zlib@:1.2.8', when='@:3.3.1')\r\n```\r\nThis should work fine, but Spack must be concretizing the zlib version before it checks for the R dependencies. The following will work:\r\n```\r\n$ spack spec r@3.3.1\r\n$ spack spec r ^zlib@1.2.8\r\n```\r\nI can also get r working by modifying the dependency so that it always depends on `zlib@:1.2.8`. I'll submit a PR for this shortly.",
