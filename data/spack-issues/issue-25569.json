    "body": "Potentially fixes #25420 \r\n\r\nThe gtk-doc configure script has an option for specifying the path to\r\nthe XML catalog. If this is not set the configure script will search\r\na defined set of directories for a catalog file and will set\r\n`with_xml_catalog` based on that. Only if no system catalog is found will\r\nthe XML_CATALOG_FILES be looked at. In order to make sure that the spack\r\nprovided catalog is used, pass the `--with-xml-catalog` option.",
