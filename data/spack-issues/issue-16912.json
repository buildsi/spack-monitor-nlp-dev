    "body": "The mpich package does not build with gcc 10. gcc 10 enforces the Fortran standard, which reports argument mismatches for certain MPI calls. This issue is well known; see e.g. <https://gcc.gnu.org/gcc-10/porting_to.html> and <https://lists.mpich.org/pipermail/discuss/2020-January/005863.html>. The work-around is to add `-fallow-argument-mismatch` to `FCFLAGS` when building mpich, and presumably also when using mpich with a Fortran compiler.\r\n\r\nHow do I set this up in the `package.py`?\r\n\r\nSo, I've tried adding `'FCFLAGS=-fallow-argument-mismatch'` to the configure arguments, and this indeed makes mpich build. I'm not familiar with how to insert this into the proper Spack mechanisms.",
