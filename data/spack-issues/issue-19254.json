    "body": "Spack seems to set the CUDAHOSTCXX environment variable in the build environment, which cmake picks up and passes to nvcc as -ccbin=(...)  Mine was g++-6.\r\n\r\nWhen compiling with mpi, cuda files cannot include <mpi.h> unless the host compiler points to the mpi wrapper.  Without this environment variable specifically set, no amount of cmake options could switch over the -ccbin from g++-6.\r\n\r\nShouldn't spack automatically set CUDAHOSTCXX to the right thing when using mpi?  Maybe I missed some documentation on this.",
