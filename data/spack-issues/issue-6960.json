    "body": "The flag_handlers method was being set as a bound method, but when reset in the package.py file it was being set as an unbound method (all python2 issues).\r\n\r\nThis gets the underlying function information in either case, which is the same.\r\n\r\nThe bug was uncovered for parmetis in #6858. This is a partial fix. Included are changes to the parmetis package.py file to make use of flag_handlers.\r\n\r\n(The other part of the fix is in #6970.)",
