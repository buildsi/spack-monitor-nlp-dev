    "body": "The argument 'buf_size' of the C function 'h5fget_file_image_c' is declared as intent(in) in its interface block in 'H5Fff.F90' or 'H5Fff_F03.f90' though it is modified by the invocation. As a result, aggressive compilers such as Fujitsu's may do a wrong optimization to generate a wrong result, and a test during the installation fails. So, 'buf_size' should be declared as intent(out).\r\n\r\nNote: This fix should be temporal and the bug should be fixed by the developer. I'll report it to them.",
