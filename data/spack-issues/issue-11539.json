    "body": "This PR adds a python preference order to default packages.yaml to help with issues relating to python2/3 concretization errors.\r\n\r\nThis doesn't solve all issues related to the 2/3 difficulty, but I think would make the 'out of the box' experience work more as expected without user customization required, especially for setups like environments and building in containers.\r\n\r\nRelated to: #11531, #11468, #11396\r\n",
