    "body": "This PR add a patch to mumps makfiles to have shared libraries linked with there dependencies.\nWhich mean applications can link with `-l{s,d,c,z}mumps` only and not with `-l{s,d,c,z}mumps -lmumps_common -lpord -l{all the external dependencies of mumps}` as discussed in #626\n\nI don't like the test that are in the package since the do not test the installed version.\nBut since there where there I modified them to actually test something. One of them at least was wrong but the return code was never checked. `os.system` does not care on the return code...\n\nI also modified the order of the make target to us parallel build where possible. \n",
