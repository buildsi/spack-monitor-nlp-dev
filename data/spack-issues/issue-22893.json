    "body": "There are some problem in version compare algorithm. For example, with versions \u201c3.0.0\u201d and \"master\" for taskflow, \"3.0.0\" will be thought as newest version( rmp project can get this result [python rpm_vercmp] ), numbers are always \"newer\" than letters. You can alter the code of version.py(Version:\\_\\_lt\\_\\_:285-297) as follow.\r\n\r\n        # Standard comparison of two numeric versions\r\n        for a, b in zip(self.version, other.version):\r\n            if a == b:\r\n                continue\r\n            else:\r\n                if a in infinity_versions:\r\n                    if b in infinity_versions:\r\n                        return (infinity_versions.index(a) >\r\n                                infinity_versions.index(b))\r\n                    else:\r\n                        return True\r\n                if b in infinity_versions:\r\n                    return False\r\n\r\n",
