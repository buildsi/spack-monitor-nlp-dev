    "body": "@adamjstewart \r\n\r\nAs a proposal, I was wondering if `build_type` method in the CMakePackage could be set by default as:\r\n\r\n```\r\ndef build_type(self):\r\n        spec = self.spec\r\n        if '+debug' in spec:\r\n            return 'Debug'\r\n        else:\r\n            return 'Release'\r\n```\r\n\r\nI think that most of CMakePackage packages define the build type in that way, but I don't know if there is any other reason to leave it to the user.
