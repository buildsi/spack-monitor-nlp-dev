    "body": "### Summary\n\nzstd should be trivial to install, and cmake is too big of a dependency\n\n### Rationale\n\ncmake itself bootstraps zstd, so we can't have zstd use cmake as a build system if we want to ship cmake properly without vendored libs: In https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/22668 I made zstd use cmake, but cmake bootstraps zstd https://github.com/Kitware/CMake/tree/master/Utilities/cmzstd, so it wasn't a great idea :(\n\n### Description\n\nuse the makefile\n\n### Additional information\n\n_No response_\n\n### General information\n\n- [X] I have run `spack --version` and reported the version of Spack\n- [X] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate",
