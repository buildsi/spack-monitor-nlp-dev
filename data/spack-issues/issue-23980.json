    "body": "Previously, we were setting `TCLLIBPATH` to `prefix/lib/tcl8.6`. With this PR, we are now setting `TCLLIBPATH` to `prefix/lib`. As far as I can tell from reading https://wiki.tcl-lang.org/page/TCLLIBPATH, this is the correct way to do things.\r\n\r\nWe are also now setting `(TCL|TK|TIX)_LIBRARY` correctly. Tix now builds for me.\r\n\r\nFixes #23780. The following commands successfully run:\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install python+tkinter\r\n$ spack load python+tkinter\r\n$ python -c 'import tkinter; tkinter._test()'\r\n```\r\n\r\n@skosukhin you can check Python if you want to but I think I have it thoroughly tested.\r\n\r\n@glennpj can you make sure this doesn't break R?\r\n\r\nWe DESPERATELY need an official maintainer for the Tcl/Tk packages, as evidenced by the dozens of comments in the package from lessons hard learned.
