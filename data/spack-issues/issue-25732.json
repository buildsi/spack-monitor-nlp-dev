    "body": "This PR requires https://github.com/spack/spack/pull/25755 (we need `setup_run_environment` to be called on dependencies)\r\n\r\nThe current default of `spack load x` is to load *all* dependencies, including build deps of build deps of build deps, which does not make any sense.\r\n\r\nThe PR changes this into loading `x` with its runtime deps. That way `spack load x` behaves equivalent to `spack env activate e` for an environment `e` which has `x` as a root spec.\r\n\r\nAlso it solves a performance issue: #25669.\r\n\r\nQuestion remains what to do with the --only flag. Should `--only=dependencies` only load runtime deps? Or should it have the original behavior of loading build deps of build deps of build deps too?\r\n\r\nNote that the discussion below about performance is largely irrelevant for this PR; performance is definitely improved, the example given by @tylerjereddy seems to be of a package that has a bunch of run-time deps that should reallly be build/link deps.\r\n\r\n",
