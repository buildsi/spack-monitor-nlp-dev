    "body": "<!-- Thanks for taking the time to report this build failure. To proceed with the report please:\r\n\r\n1. Title the issue \"Installation issue: <name-of-the-package>\".\r\n2. Provide the information required below.\r\n\r\nWe encourage you to try, as much as possible, to reduce your problem to the minimal example that still reproduces the issue. That would help us a lot in fixing it quickly and effectively! -->\r\n\r\n### Steps to reproduce the issue\r\n\r\n<!-- Fill in the exact spec you are trying to build and the relevant part of the error message -->\r\n```console\r\n$ spack install boost@1.76.0%nvhpc@21.5\r\n...\r\n==> Installing boost-1.76.0-egxydhpfoggdbo6iob76xudt3sysrxcl\r\n==> No binary for boost-1.76.0-egxydhpfoggdbo6iob76xudt3sysrxcl found: installing from source\r\n==> Using cached archive: /spack/var/spack/cache/_source-cache/archive/f0/f0397ba6e982c4450f27bf32a2a83292aba035b827a5623a14636ea583318c41.tar.bz2\r\n3 out of 3 hunks FAILED -- saving rejects to file tools/build/src/engine/build.sh.rej\r\n==> Patch /spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/boost/nvhpc.patch failed.\r\n==> Error: ProcessError: Command exited with status 1:\r\n    '/usr/bin/patch' '-s' '-p' '1' '-i' '/spack/var/spack/repos/builtin/packages/boost/nvhpc.patch' '-d' '.'\r\n```\r\nIt appears that the `nvhpc.patch` added by @samcmill to override the PGI configuration in  `tools/build/src/engine/build.sh` with nvhpc compilers is out of date. It would be nice if this configuration was supported natively.\r\n\r\n### Information on your system\r\n\r\n<!-- Please include the output of `spack debug report` -->\r\n* **Spack:** 0.16.2-3241-1bccd866ae\r\n* **Python:** 3.6.8\r\n* **Platform:** linux-rhel7-power9le\r\n* **Concretizer:** original\r\n\r\n<!-- If you have any relevant configuration detail (custom `packages.yaml` or `modules.yaml`, etc.) you can add that here as well. -->\r\n\r\n### Additional information\r\n* [build.sh.rej.txt](https://github.com/spack/spack/files/6703622/build.sh.rej.txt)\r\n\r\n<!-- Some packages have maintainers who have volunteered to debug build failures. Run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mention them here if they exist. -->\r\n@hainest \r\n### General information\r\n\r\n<!-- These boxes can be checked by replacing [ ] with [x] or by clicking them after submitting the issue. -->\r\n- [x] I have run `spack debug report` and reported the version of Spack/Python/Platform\r\n- [x] I have run `spack maintainers <name-of-the-package>` and @mentioned any maintainers\r\n- [x] I have uploaded the build log and environment files\r\n- [x] I have searched the issues of this repo and believe this is not a duplicate\r\n",
